Measurement Methods

All measurement results are based on digital 22 or 24-bit resolution sampling of the voltage
and current signals provided to each of the unit’s input channels. The analog-to-digital
conversion technique used is a proprietary 2-stage compound ADC method.
The signals themselves are not modified prior to sampling other than fixed scaling and
minimal low-pass filtering to reduce sampling anomalies. The only modifications made to
the samples are:




Application of calibration scaling and offsets.
Adding or subtracting scaled current samples from the voltages samples, or vice
versa, to compensate for the V or A terminal burden of the channel as enabled by
the ADJUST configuration setting.
Low-pass filtering according to the BANDWIDTH configuration setting.

M2000 SERIES OPERATION MANUAL
SECTION 3: PRODUCT OVERVIEW

The following measurements are all performed by the power analyzer at all times as
required. Unless otherwise stated, these are continuously applied using all samples of the
signals:
Frequency

The frequency of a selected voltage or current signal within each VPA has its
frequency measured using all samples obtained for the selected signal.
Frequency is determined using the reciprocal period of zero value crossings
of the band-pass filtered selected signal samples.

Highest and lowest peaks
The highest and lowest of all samples obtained for each
signal within each measurement period are recorded as the highest and
lowest peak measurement results.
Lowest half-cycle valley
The largest of all samples obtained for each signal within
each half-cycle of the fundamental period is recorded, the smallest of these
recorded half-cycle samples within each measurement period is recorded as
the signal valley measurement results.
Other non-harmonic measurement results All other non-harmonic measurements are
performed using all samples within each measurement period. All AC and
AC+DC measurement results are the RMS values, and all DC measurement
results are the mean values during each measurement period.
Harmonic analysis An anti-aliased sub-set of the samples used for non-harmonic
measurements within each measurement period are used for DFT based
harmonic analysis. Each set is collected and analyzed before another set
may be collected (for EN61000-3-2 and -12 the analysis is performed within
each measurement period so there is never a delay between periods).
Spectral analysis
An anti-aliased set of samples are used for DFT based spectrum
analysis; each set is collected and then analyzed before another set is
collected.
Scope trigger detection and capture A set of samples are used for scope trigger
detection and capture; each set is collected and then analyzed before
another set may be collected.
In all instances, the measurement results are the direct results of these analyses methods.
For example, neither the measurement results nor the calibration scaling applied are
modified for signal frequency content.

Figure 3-3: Channel Input Circuits

Each electrical channel provides the power analyzer with one voltage and one current
measurement, simultaneously sampled to provide optimal power measurement accuracy.
The unit can have one to four electrical channels installed.
Each electrical channel can be one of two available types and each with one of three current
input options. Which channel type and current input option is installed in each position is
indicated by a the last character of the M2000 Model number (“D” or “X”) and the letter
code (“AD” or “AX”) shown the upper left corner of each channel sub-panel. Both channel
types provides total 0.03% accuracy, 1MHz class bandwidth, 24bit sampling and a 1000Vrms
maximum continuous voltage input.
The current input option is denoted by the second letter of the two letter code:
D

Dual Shunt (up to 20Arms continuous and 150Apk inrush) in a single input
terminal pair with resolution down to 0.1μA, also capable of supporting an
external current output CT.

X

For use with an external shunt or low impedance voltage output CT (20μV to
15Vrms) with resolution down to 0.1μV.

SECTION 3: PRODUCT OVERVIEW

Each channel can be independently configured for voltage scaling (when using an external
PT) and/or current offset and scaling (when using an external CT or shunt).
3.2.4

Sampling Control

There are three sampling controls in a M2000. Typically each is associated with a VPA,
however if you configure the LF/PERIOD setting in a VPA to synchronize that VPA to a lower
numbered VPA then the sampling control of that VPA is used for the channels in the VPA so
configured.
Sampling control performs the following:


Calculation of the measurement period for measurement results.
 The measurement period is adjusted to be an integer number of
fundamental cycles which is the closest to the configured measurement
period for the controlling VPA.
 A half-cycle period is also generated for controlling the period of half-cycle
valley measurements.



Calculation and control of the sampling period of channels.
 The required sampling period is calculated to yield an integer number of
samples in a measurement period which gives the closest sampling period
to the nominal sampling period for the channels being controlled. The
sampling period is also adjusted to not yield an integer number of samples
in any harmonic (including the fundamental) over 500Hz. The nominal
sampling period for the AD and AX channel types is 245KSPS.
 Each actual sampling period is controlled with 2.5ps average resolution and
2.6ns incremental resolution with a quasi-random distribution of
incremental sample periods within a range sufficient to avoid Nyquist
sampling limits.
 This yields an effective sampling rate of 384MSPS and synchronization to
the measured fundamental to within <1ppm.



Starting and stopping measurement periods.
 If the M2000 measurement mode is configured to anything other than
SYNC-VPA then each sampling control always immediately starts a
measurement period when the previous one ends. In this manner all
channel and VPA measurements are totally ‘gapless’.
 If the M2000 measurement mode is configured to SYNC-VPA then each
sampling control will start all measurement periods if all measurement
periods have ended. In this manner all channel and VPA measurements are
synchronized, but only the longest one is ‘gapless’.

3.2.5

Channel Measurements

For each of the channels the following measurements are performed:
 Voltage and current DC (the average of the samples in the measurement period).



Voltage and current maximum peak (the highest sample in the measurement
period).
Voltage and current minimum peak (the lowest sample in the measurement period).
Voltage and current half-cycle based valley measurements.
Voltage and current rectified (the average modulus sample in the measurement
period).
Voltage and current RMS (the square root of the average squared sample in the
measurement period).
Watts (the average of the voltage and current samples multiplied together in the
measurement period)

Harmonic amplitude and phase analysis of the voltage and current samples (using Fourier
Transforms). This analysis is only performed if a) the fundamental frequency is known, and
b) you have configured for at least 1 harmonic to be analyzed.
Formulation of the Cycle View data from all samples in the measurement period. Cycle view
places every sample from the measurement period at the correct phase to build a single
cycle formed from all cycles present during the measurement period. This uses the results of
the harmonic analysis at the fundamental to position the samples correctly and it uses the
fundamental frequency.
Spectral analysis of the voltage and current samples (using Fourier Transforms). This analysis
is only performed if configured.
For AD Card Type only (if configured for auto-range):
 At any time during a measurement period, if the selected range is LO and the
current is at least close to overload level, the HI range is immediately used in this
channel and the relevant sampling control starts a new measurement period.
However, all channels in the affected VPA do not discard the existing peak results
when starting this measurement period.
 If at the end of the measurement period the selected range is HI but all samples
within the measurement were below a level indicating that the LO range may be
used, then the LO range is selected prior to starting the next measurement period.

Virtual Power Analyzers™

The M2000 Power Analyzer supports a unique Virtual Power Analyzer capability that allows
up to three uniquely configured power analyzers to be defined by the user. These so called
VPAs can share physical measurement input channels as needed and can be configured for
either one-phase, two-phase or three-phase instruments across the up to four available
input cards.
The channels assigned to a single VPA do not have to be physically adjacent, for example it is
OK to configure CH1 and CH4 in one VPA and CH2 and CH3 in another one.
Each VPA can be independently configured for measurement period, LF and HF filtering,
harmonic analysis, signal filtering, default measurement coupling, results smoothing and
displayed significant digits, multi-channel wiring configuration, and efficiency grouping.
VPAs may optionally be configured to be synchronized to each other.

3.5

VPA Measurements

3.5.1

VPA Fundamental Frequency

Each VPA provides a fundamental frequency to its associated sampling control as
determined by the FUND configuration setting in the VPA. This may be by measurement, by
configuration, or from another VPA.
If the fundamental frequency is measured, it is from the voltage or current in the lowest
numbered channel in the VPA and uses the following method:
Frequency is determined by measurement of the period between zero crossings of the
output of a digital band-pass filter, which uses the configured samples from the channel.
 Hysteresis is used on the zero crossing detection to prevent near fundamental signal
components from creating false zero crossing detections.
 Because the filtering is band-pass, the frequency is established regardless of any DC
signal content.
 The low frequency corner of the band-pass filter is set by the LF/PERIOD setting for
the VPA.
 The high frequency corner of the band-pass filter is continuously adjusted to match
the measured frequency. The maximum corner frequency of this filter is limited by
the FUND setting of the VPA.
To correctly detect the edges of the waveform, there must be at least 3 samples in each
cycle, thus the maximum measurable frequency is just over 80kHz AD and AX channel types.
3.5.2

VPA Amplitude Measurements

For each of the VPAs the following measurements are performed depending on the WIRING
configuration of the VPA.
N x 1ø

There are no VPA measurements performed.

measurements of the sum of the three channel currents (this produces
the results for N data).

VPA measurements are a sub-set of the channel voltage/current measurements:
 DC
Average of the samples in the measurement period.
 Peak
Highest modulus sample in the measurement period.
 Rectified Average modulus sample in the measurement period.
 RMS
Square root of the average squared sample in the measurement period.

VPA Application Examples

3.6.1

SINGLE VPA

Using a single VPA is relevant when there is only an individual power interface that requires
monitoring. If there are up to four independent single phase AC or DC EUTs (N * 1ø), this
configuration can be extended by adding up to four channels to the same VPA. Other power
configurations can be two, three or four phase as well.

Photovoltaic Power Generators (DC in; DC or AC out)

There are also other dual VPA configurations not shown here. For example:
If the neutral current is to be measured rather than computed from the other phases for a
2ø3w or 3ø4w supply or load, this can be is accomplished by using a second VPA for just the
neutral current measuring channel and setting that VPA to be fully synchronous with the
main VPA.
If a load has both AC and DC supply inputs (or vice versa), or two different frequency AC
supplies, each supply can be measured using a separate VPAs and an efficiency group used
to produce the total input (or output) power from both VPAs.

Each VPA is independently configured and has the same capabilities as previously
described for single VPA applications (except only a single oscilloscope in one VPA is
allowed).
Each VPA can be configured as N x 1ø, 2ø3w, 3ø3w (2ch), 3ø3w (3ch) or 3ø4w
limited by the total number of channels installed.
Overall efficiency and power loss can be measured.

Different frequency content signals but make measurements over times,
which are synchronized to each other.
Same frequency content signals and make measurements over exactly the
same periods of time (the oscilloscope captures the signals in both VPAs in

TRIPLE VPAs

Using three VPAs allows multi-stage power conversion circuits to be monitored as long as
four channels are sufficient to cover all stages. This is most relevant to single phase AC and
DC converter inputs and outputs.
Applications:
Examples of triple VPA applications as shown in the diagram below include:

Emergency Lighting Ballasts (most types)
Standby or Backup Power Supplies (AC or DC)

There are also other triple VPA configurations which are not shown here. For example:


If a facility has a backup or PV source of power, an internal power distribution, and
also access to a network supply then three VPAs can be used, one measuring each
of these. In this case you should note that the M2000 can also separately integrate

Efficiency and power loss can be measured, overall and for each intermediate stage.
For the example shown above, the total charge and discharge AHr for the battery
can be measured.
The VPAs may be configured as either:
 Independent and having different frequency content signals to each other.
 Different frequency content signals but make measurements over times,
which are synchronized to each other.
 Same frequency content signals and make measurements over exactly the
same periods of time (the oscilloscope captures the signals in both VPAs in
this case).

Data Collection

Data collection gathers together the measurement results from the Channel and VPA
Measurements to provide all final measurement results. In many cases, this involves more
than one actual measurement result with calculations performed to produce each final
result. All final measurement results are continuously calculated and have the configured
response filtering applied. Those results are then held as required if you have commanded
to hold measurements. In this manner, all response filtered results have the correct and
linear response filtering characteristics.
Examples of final results computations include:
 AC voltages and currents are computed from the DC and AC+DC RMS measurement
results using the fact that (AC+DC)2 = (AC)2 + (DC)2
 DC Watts for a channel is computed from the multiplication of the DC voltage and
current (and is identical to DC VA).
 AC Watts for a channel is computed using the fact that W(AC+DC) = W(DC) + W(AC)
 VA for a channel is computed from the multiplication of the appropriate voltage and
current data.
 PF (for a channel or for a VPA) is computed using the fact that PF = W / VA.
 VAR for a channel is computed using the fact that VA2 = W2 + VAR2 with the polarity
of the resultant VAR set according to the configured lead/lag information.
 VPA total Watts is computed from the sum of the Watts for the channels in the VPA
 VPA total VAR and VA is computed according to the method selected in the
configuration for that VPA.
 VPA overall lead/lag is taken from the polarity of the sum of the channel VAR for the
VPA.
 The total Watts for an efficiency group is the sum of the VPA total Watts for each
VPA configured by the EFF/LOSS setting to be in the requested group.

3.8

Integrated Data

At the end of every measurement period in any VPA, all integrated results are accumulated
with the product of the result and the entire measurement period time - if integration was
neither started nor stopped during it - or a partial measurement period time - if integration
was started and/or stopped during it.

Voltage Accuracy Examples

This section shows how to use accuracy specifications to determine the overall accuracy of
voltage measurements under various typical conditions.
Example 1
For an AD or AX type channel the maximum error of a measurement of the AC+DC voltage
of a 230Vrms signal at 50Hz is a worst case of ± 0.034% of reading as calculated by:
Scaling Errors:
Base Scaling = ±0.03%
Frequency Dependent Scaling = None at MAINS
Self-heating Scaling = ±0.05%*(230V/1000)2 = ±0.002645%
Temperature Scaling = none within 5C of the calibration temperature
Bandwidth Limit Scaling = none when using AUTO-TRACK
Total Scaling errors = ±0.032645% of reading
Floor Errors:
Base Floor = 450μV
DC Floor = (0V/230V)*1mV = 0
AC floor = (100μV/230V) at MAINS = 0.43μV (can be ignored)
Common-Mode = if not 3ø3w(2ch) wiring = none
Common-Mode = if 3ø3w(2ch) wiring = 1μV*(230V/√3)*50Hz = 6.6mV at (30+90)° =

Example 2
For an AD or AX type channel the maximum error of a measurement of the fundamental of a

Example 3
For an AD or AX type channel the maximum error of a measurement of a 10%THD of a

calculated by:
(0.005+0.000025*N)*%THD = (0.005+(0.000025*50))*10 = 0.0625%THD
0.00005*N*√N = 0.00005*50*√50 = 0.0177%THD

Example 2
For an AD channel (HI range) the maximum error of a measurement of the fundamental

Example 1
For an AD channel (HI range) the maximum error of a measurement of the AC+DC PF of a

calculated by:

0.0000000017) = -0.00000003
DC Floor = (1-0.5) * (( 0.15mA / 5A ) + (1mV / 240V )) = ±0.00001708
Total Floor Errors = ±0.000018
Phase Errors:

Total Phase Errors = ±0.000011
Example 2
As Example 1 but where the PF=0.5 is caused by load distortion instead of phase shift, the
maximum error of the measurement of the AC+DC PF is a worst case of ±0.000018 as
calculated by:
Floor Errors:
Base Floor = (38μA / 5A) + (450μV / 240V ) = ±0.000009475
AC Floor = -0.5 * ((( 1.5μA / 5A ) / 5A ) + (( 100μV / 240V ) / 240V )) = -0.5 * ( 0.00000006

DC Floor = ( 1-0.5 ) * ((0.15mA / 5A ) + (1mV / 240V )) = ±0.00001708
Total Floor Errors = ±0.000018
Phase Errors:
PFFUND = 1.0 since load has no phase shift only distortion.
(1 – cos ( cos-1(1) + 0.015° * 0.05 )) = (1 – cos (0° + 0.015° * 0.05 )) = 0

Unpacking and Installation
5.1

Inspection

The M2000 Series of Power Analyzers are carefully inspected before shipment. If instrument
damage has occurred during transport, please inform Adaptive Power Systems’ nearest
sales and service office or representative.
The Power Analyzer is supplied ready to use – it comes complete with an appropriate power
lead and a set of test leads. It is supplied calibrated and does not require anything to be
done by the user before it can be put into service.
The unit is grounded via the AC Input. A line cord with proper Earth Ground must be used at
all times. Correct grounding of your electrical system infrastructure according to applicable
national standards must also be observed.

5.2

Unpacking

Always inspect the carton for any sign of damage that may have occurred during shipment.
If damage to the carton is visible, file a report with the carrier.
After removing the power analyzer from its shipping carton, carefully inspect the unit for
any sign of damage before attempting to operate. If any abnormality is noted then it is
recommended that the unit be serviced prior to being placed into use, as safety may have
been compromised. In that case, contact Adaptive Power Systems support department to
obtain a Material Return Authorization (RMA) or Case number.
Inside the carton, there should be the following items:
1. M2000 unit
2. US mains power cord
3. Two color coded Alligator Clip leads
4. Certificate of Calibration
If any of these items is missing, contact Adaptive Power Systems support department.

SECTION 5: UNPACKING AND INSTALLATION

5.3

Powering Up

Before connecting any of the test leads to an active circuit, first connect the mains cord
from a properly grounded supply outlet to the inlet on the rear panel of the M2000. This
unit has a universal mains input and accepts any supply voltage from 85-264 Vrms at 50 or
60Hz.
SAFETY WARNING:
The M2000 must be connected using a power cable with a continuous ground
connection and must be plugged into a source of power which provides a safety
ground. If a safety ground is not present then the unit’s chassis must be safety
grounded by the user prior to applying mains or signals to the unit using the rear
panel chassis ground terminal.

Figure 5-2: Main Power Entry and Chassis Ground Socket Locations

Note:

The M2000 power on behavior is configurable; when initially shipped from the
factory, the unit is powered on or off solely controlled by the touch panel. If the
power on configuration setting has been changed by the user, the unit may power
on immediately when mains is first applied without any other user action.

When initially powered the front panel POWER indicator LED will be illuminated RED.
Either using the tip of a finger, or using a stylus designed for use with a touch panel, press
and hold anywhere on the touch panel for at least ½ second. Do not use excessive force, the
POWER indicator LED brightens when the panel is detected as being touched.
Note:

DO NOT USE A PEN OR A SCREWDRIVER OR A SIMILAR IMPLEMENT WITH SHARP
CORNERS AS IT MAY DAMAGE THE TOUCH PANEL.

Figure 5-3: Turning Power Analyzer On or Off

The unit will now power on and you may release the touch panel. The front panel POWER
indicator LED will change to GREEN and the LCD screen will show an initial welcoming
graphic for about 2 seconds and then the unit will start normal operation.

5.4

Turning Power Off
Unless it is unavoidable, DO NOT power down the unit by removing the source of
mains power to it or unplugging its line cord. It is strongly recommended that all
input signals be removed from all the unit’s input channels prior to powering down.

To manually power off the unit after removing all input signals, press and hold the POWER
button in the lower right corner of the screen. This button must be pressed for at least ¾
second to power down the unit.
Note: If any channel has current flowing which is over its capability to withstand when
powered down then the unit will not power down and the POWER button will be
colored red while it is pressed.
The unit may delay powering down if it still has unsaved data. During this delay, a message
is displayed on the screen. This typically lasts less than a second.
If the unit has been configured to always be powered up, the unit will almost immediately
power back on after any attempt to turn it off.

5.5

In Case of Malfunction

In the unlikely event of an instrument malfunction or if the instrument does not turn on
despite the presence of the correct AC line voltage, please attach a warning tag to the
instrument to identify the owner and indicate that service or repair is required. Contact
Adaptive Power Systems or its authorized representative to arrange for service.

Front Panel Operation
This section is intended as a Quick Start Guide to become familiar with the front panel
operation of the Power Analyzer.

6.1

Front Panel Layout

All operations are performed using the touch-sensitive color LCD screen. There are no
buttons or switches anywhere on the M2000 mainframe. The front panel also has a USB
drive or printer interface connector and a power on/off/standby indicator LED.

Make sure the power analyzer is powered ON before proceeding.

6.2

On Screen Buttons Operation

The M2000 Mainframe has on-screen buttons that allow you to interact and configure the
unit. Pressing a button other than the POWER button (lower right corner) almost
immediately causes the desired action for that button. The POWER button must be
maintained pressed for approx. ¾ second for the action to be taken.
If a button color turns red while pressed, that button is disabled, typically because there is
only one choice for the selectable data or the unit is in remote control state and preventing
that configuration setting from being altered. Otherwise a button color turns green while it
is pressed.
In many cases, the color of a button is used to indicate whether the labelled condition is
active or not. In these cases the button is colored with a light green color to indicate that
the labelled condition is active, otherwise it is a silver color (inactive).
Many buttons have two lines of text and the upper line is of a larger font size than the lower
one. The lower line of text shows the selected setting associated with the button, which can
be changed by pressing this button. In some cases it shows an associated entered value

which may be shown with less resolution than for actual data entry. In all cases the full
resolution of the entered data is used.
In a few cases pressing a button initiates a series of entries, the combination of which
configures the setting or action associated with the button. If the button initiates the entry
of data or selection of a choice then that is performed on a new screen.
Pressing the RETURN button on the data entry/choice screen either returns to the screen
from which the entry was initiated or initiates a screen for the next associated entry, as long
as further entries are required.
Pressing the CANCEL button on the data entry/choice screen discards the entry and any
associated entries made and returns to the screen from which the entry was initiated.

6.3

Getting Started

Decide what it is you want to measure. For now, we will just look at a single VPA application
and tackle the more complex applications later. A VPA is a Virtual Power Analyzer; the
M2000 has up to three of them, allowing for up to three different sets of power
measurements in the same unit. In this section, we will just use one.
Next, connect the power analyzer to the EUT. Make sure there is no voltage present when
making these connections. See section 5.6, “Channel Wiring” on page 57 to make the power
analyzer is connected correctly for the type of EUT.

6.4

Configure the VPA

Configure the unit using these steps:
1. Press the MEAS CONFIG button on the M2000 screen. If needed, see section 12.1
for full details regarding using the touch panel and section 12.4 for full details
regarding configuration.
We start with settings that are usable for just about any application; you can always
come back and change these later if you want to optimize them for your specific
application. Everything is visible on the one screen, which is shown by pressing one
button, so it’s easy to remember how to change settings later.
What you are now seeing is all you wi
2. ll ever need to configure for many applications.
The present setting is shown in each button in a smaller text size, if you see anything
that needs changing, press the corresponding button to change it.

Select Data to Display

Viewing result data requires just a single press on one of the upper seven buttons down the
right side of the screen to view that screen. On each of these screens, you can select several
different ways of looking at the measurements. In all cases, the buttons across the top of
each screen allow you to select what you’re looking at. A brief summary of each screen is as
follows:
POWER DATA: enables you to view numerical results for:


All voltage, current, and power (W, VA, VAR and PF) measurements; in peak,
RMS, fundamental only, or rectified forms.
 Inrush.
 Resistive, inductive and capacitive loading.
 Integrated and long-term average measurements (e.g. Watt-Hours).
 Efficiency and power loss.
CUSTOM DATA: enables you to view just about any numerical data you wish, along with
descriptive text. You can configure a wide variety of formats for this screen.
HARMONICS: enables you to view voltage, current, power, and inter-phase voltage
harmonics in both graphical and numerical formats.
VECTORS: enables you to view single or multi-channel voltage and current graphically as
vectors on a polar chart.
HISTORY: enables you to see what happened in the past without needing configuration
beforehand. Gives a graphical chart of most measurement results with powerful
zooming capabilities.
SCOPE: enables you to view the voltage, current, power and inter-phase voltage
waveforms without needing configuration (CYCLE VIEW), or to use the M2000 as a
powerful oscilloscope (SCOPE VIEW).
STBY POWER: enables you to configure, run and view the results of EN50564 low power
measurements in both numerical and graphical formats.
ASSESS EUT: enables you to configure, perform and view the results of EN61000-3-2 or EN61000-3-12 assessments of a EUT (if measurements have been configured to do so).
The unit remembers what you have configured, which results screen you are looking at, and
how you have setup that screen. If you turn off the unit. When you turn it back on it is

configured just like you left it. Note that is recommended to remove any power from your
application when turning off the unit.
The power analyzer always measures everything that is configured to be measured.
Measurements are not dependent on which screen you are looking at. For example, you can
configure an oscilloscope capture on the SCOPE screen, change to another screen and then
come back to the SCOPE screen later to see what has been captured.
If your signals have any instability, the results displayed by the power analyzer may respond
to that instability by making results difficult to read. In those situations, go back to the MEAS
CONFIG for that VPA and adjust one or more of the following settings:




Set the RESPONSE setting to a slower response. This averages all results over a
number of measurement periods.
Set the LF/PERIOD setting to a longer measurement period. This slows down the
changes in the results.
Set the DIGITS setting to less displayed digits. This reduces the resolution on most
numerical results.

Simply exporting a screen image to a USB drive file enables you to document your results for
any screen. You can also export and import configurations to/from files on a USB drive,
giving you the freedom to experiment with configuration settings without worrying about
being able to return to a prior known configuration. See section 9, “USB Drive Usage” on
page 208 for details regarding this.

Note: Preferences other than POWER CTRL cannot be changed while in remote.
To change any of these settings, press the relevant button. The screen will change to a
screen enabling you to select your preference for that setting.
Press the RETURN button to save your preferences and return to the SYS CONFIG screen.
Pressing CANCEL returns to the SYS CONFIG screen without saving any changes you have
made.
Selecting a POWER CTRL Preference
The POWER CTRL button allows you to select how the power analyzer is turned on and off.
If NORMAL is selected, the touch panel is used for turning the unit on and off. After a power
interruption, the unit will remain off until manually turned on.
If AUTO-ON is selected, the touch panel can be used to turn the unit on and off, but the unit
will also power on when power is first applied. After a power interruption, the unit will turn
on.
If ALWAYS ON is selected then the unit is always turned on while power is applied.
Recommendations:

For bench-top use NORMAL is recommended
For use in an ATE system - e.g. a 19” rack test system - either
AUTO-ON or ALWAYS ON is recommended

Selecting an AUTOZERO Preference
The AUTOZERO button allows you to select if the power analyzer occasionally checks if the
DC zero requires adjusting for changes in the operating environment.

M2000 SERIES OPERATION MANUAL
SECTION 6: FRONT PANEL OPERATION

If ON is selected then the unit will occasionally - every few minutes in a typical environment
- adjust its’ DC zero to track any changes to the environment. This incurs a 20ms gap
between measurements once every few minutes in a typical environment (a 99.99% signal
capture probability for non-recurring transients lasting <20ms). Note that this setting cannot
effect SCOPE actions (e.g. inrush current detection); once a SCOPE trigger detection is
initiated, DC zero adjustments are automatically disabled until completed.
If OFF is selected then the DC zero will slightly change if the environment changes, however
the transient signal capture probability is 100%.
Recommendations:

In almost all applications this will be set to ON. Only select OFF if
you are concerned about a nominally 0.01% probability of not
capturing non-recurring transient signal events lasting less than
20ms.

Selecting a VAR POLARITY Preference
The VAR POLARITY button allows you to select the meaning of the polarity of all VAR
(reactive power) measurement results.


If +LEAD is selected, a positive VAR result indicates that current is leading the
voltage.



If +LAG is selected, a positive VAR result indicates that current is lagging the voltage.

Recommendations:

For most applications the use of the +LEAD setting is recommended.

Note: Mathematically VAR has usually been described as the ‘sine’ relationship to the
phase shift of the current relative to the voltage so resulting in a positive VAR
indicating a leading current, but in certain industries the opposite convention is
used where a positive VAR indicates a lagging current.
Note: By definition, lead/lag is indicated by the polarity of VAR and not by any other
measurement result. Showing lead/lag by the polarity of PF is incorrect but has
historically been done as a result of limitations in simpler Watt meters. The M2000
does not follow this historical use of the polarity of PF but instead uses the
mathematical polarity for PF (note that PF = W / VA, so PF has the polarity of Watts).
Selecting a ΣVA or ΣVAR Preference
The ΣVA or ΣVAR button allows you to select the method by which total VA and total VAR
results (i.e. the results for an entire VPA) are computed.
If Σ(VAR) is selected then:
Total VAR = Σ(VAR).
Total VA is computed using (total VA)2 = (Σ(W))2+(Σ(VAR))2
If Σ(VA) is selected then –
Total VAR is computed using (total VAR)2 = (total VA)2-(Σ(W))2.
Total VA for each VPA depends on the WIRING selection for each VPA:

SECTION 6: FRONT PANEL OPERATION

3ø3w(2ch):
Otherwise:
Recommendations:

total VA = (Σ(VA))*(√3)/2
total VA = Σ(VA)
If you have previously used the Σ(VA) method (which is used by
some other manufacturers of Power Analyzers) then it is
recommended to use that setting. Otherwise the Σ(VAR) should be
selected as it matches the mathematical approach.

Note: Since this selection affects the total VA results, this selection also affects the total PF
results. Only for pure sinewave voltages and currents with the expected phase shift
between the voltages and a perfectly balanced load is there no difference in the
results between these selections.
Selecting a FREQ SPEED Preference
The FREQ SPEED button allows you to select how quickly the power analyzer measures and
responds to changes in the fundamental frequency.
If FAST is selected, the power analyzer measures the fundamental frequency using the
fastest possible measurement period (and the least resolution) and will respond as quickly
as possible to changes detected. If configured for LF or VLF operation by the LF/PERIOD
setting in the MEAS CONFIG screen for a VPA and if a change in fundamental frequency
of >1% occurs then any amplitude measurements in progress are terminated and new
measurements are started using this new frequency.
If NORMAL is selected, the power analyzer measures the fundamental frequency using a
measurement period optimized for both speed and resolution. Changes in the fundamental
frequency are not applied until the next amplitude measurement is started.
If SLOW is selected, the power analyzer measures the fundamental frequency using a long
measurement period which provides the best resolution. Changes in the fundamental
frequency are not applied until the next amplitude measurement is started.
Note: When configured for EN61000-3-2 or -12 measurements this preference setting is
ignored.
Recommendations:

For most applications the NORMAL setting should be used.
For applications where it is desirable to track changes in the
fundamental frequency as closely as possible (e.g. a variable speed
motor) or when using the power analyzer at frequencies below 1Hz,
the FAST setting should be considered.
For applications where the fundamental frequency is considerably
affected by modulation or other effects, the SLOW setting should be
considered.

Selecting a PHASE Preference
The PHASE button allows you to select how phase information is displayed and returned via
an interface. The power analyzer supports several methods of showing phase results as

range from -180° to +180° and the chart on the VECTORS screen
(see 12.8) is displayed with increasing phase as a counter-clockwise
rotation of the chart.

Math,360°,CW

The unit returns all phase results as mathematical phases in the
range from 0° to 360° (no polarity is displayed) and the chart on the
VECTORS screen (see 6.14.1) is displayed with increasing phase as a
clockwise rotation of the chart.

Math, 360°,CCW

The unit returns all phase results as mathematical phases in the
range from 0° to 360° (no polarity is displayed) and the chart on the
VECTORS screen (see 12.8) is displayed with increasing phase as a
counter-clockwise rotation of the chart.

Delay,+/-180°,CW

The unit returns all phase results as phase delays in the range from 180° to +180° and the chart on the VECTORS screen (see 12.8) is
displayed with increasing phase as a clockwise rotation of the chart.

Delay,+/-180°,CCW

The unit returns all phase results as phase delays in the range from 180° to +180° and the chart on the VECTORS screen (see 12.8) is
displayed with increasing phase as a counter-clockwise rotation of
the chart.

Delay,360°,CW

The unit returns all phase results as phase delays in the range from
0° to 360° (no polarity is displayed) and the chart on the VECTORS
screen (see 12.8) is displayed with increasing phase as a clockwise
rotation of the chart.

Delay, 360°,CCW

The unit returns all phase results as phase delays in the range from
0° to 360° (no polarity is displayed) and the chart on the VECTORS
screen (see 12.8) is displayed with increasing phase as a counterclockwise rotation of the chart.

Notes: If a Math preference for phase is selected then if a phase of ø is shown then
mathematically the signal is S.sin(ωt + ø).
If a Delay preference for phase is selected then if a phase of ø is shown then
mathematically the signal is S.sin(ωt - ø).
The selection of the numeric range for phase results does not affect the results
themselves. Phase results in the range 0° to +180° are unaffected; results in the

Configuring the Remote Control Interface

You may initiate the Interface Configure Screen by either pressing the Interface Info Area
while on any main screen, or pressing the SYS CONFIG button and then pressing the
INTERFACE button on that screen.
Note: Changes to the interfaces can only be made while not in remote.

There are two areas shown on this screen. The upper area allows you to set a symbolic
name (alias) for the power analyzer or to use the factory default name. It also allows you to
set whether the unit participates in a multi-unit group and if so, which group number to
participate in.
The lower area allows you to select the active interface and the configuration for that
interface.
The currently selected interface (if any) is shown highlighted in green. Pressing any of the
upper interface buttons toggles the selection active or inactive (only one interface can be
active at any time).
Below each interface button are the buttons allowing that interface to be configured. It is
not necessary to enable an interface to be able to configure it. Any changes made have an
immediate effect.
Note: The settings for the LAN interface are always used and the LAN interface is always
enabled to operate. Whether the LAN interface is selected (or not) only selects
whether the LAN interface can be used to control the unit from a computer.

Using an Interface Alias
The M2000 can be configured to have a name as an alias associated with this specific
instrument as follows:
NONE

Unit will not have an associated identity and the mDNS protocol will
not be used via the LAN interface.

FACTORY

Unit will have a name formed from the model number, a dash
character and the serial number. The M2000 will use the mDNS
protocol to establish the uniqueness of this name via the LAN
interface.

USER SET

Unit will have a name defined by you. The unit will use the mDNS
protocol to establish the uniqueness of this name via the LAN
interface.

Interface Configuration Settings
For RS232, only the Baud Rate needs to be set.
For USB, no further configuration setting apply.
For LAN, the following settings must be defined:
DHCP

Press the AUTO-IP/DHCP/STATIC IP button and select DHCP. There is no
other configuration required and if the LAN interface is enabled the
remaining buttons show the configuration obtained (while obtaining the
configuration the text in the buttons is colored orange).

IP ADDR

Press the AUTO-IP/DHCP/STATIC IP button and select STATIC IP, then
manually enter the IP ADDR, SUBNET and GATEWAY addresses. Consult your
IT department to obtain the correct settings for these.
If the configured IP address is colored red, then this indicates that the unit
has detected another device on the network which is using that IP address.

LAN Mode Press the AUTO-IP/DHCP/STATIC IP button and select AUTO-IP. There is no
other configuration required and if the LAN interface is enabled the
remaining buttons show the configuration obtained (while obtaining an IP
address in this manner, the text in the buttons is colored orange).
This obtains an IP address using the Link-Local method (defined by RFC3927)
and often called Link-Local, Zeroconf, IPv4LL, or APIPA. The address selected
will be in the range from 169.254.1.0 to 169.254.254.255 and it will change
each time the interface is linked. For a Windows™ computer, it should be
configured for DHCP, even if one is not present (in practice it does not affect
operation if one is present as the computer will be able to access the unit at
its local address). Since traffic using this range of IP addresses should not

MEASUREMENT CONFIG Screen

All measurement configuration of the power analyzer is performed in the MEAS CONFIG
Screen, accessed by pressing the MEAS CONFIG button. An example of this screen is shown
below.

Figure 6-3: MEASUREMENT CONFIGURATION Screen

Changes made to the measurement configuration do not become active until this screen is
navigated away from, i.e. one of the other Main Screen Select Buttons is pressed.
Note: Measurement settings cannot be changed while in remote mode. If you press the
MEAS CONFIG button while showing the MEAS CONFIG screen, any changes made
will be discarded and the screen will return to showing the presently used
configuration.
6.8.1

Selecting Overall Measurement Mode

Press the MEAS MODE button to display the screen which allows you to select the
measurement mode the unit. The following modes are available:
SINGLE VPA

Only a single VPA may be used (VPA1) and many other choice selections are
simplified.

MULTI VPA

Up to three VPAs may be used (VPA1, 2 and 3). Each of these will make their
measurement asynchronously to each other (unless synchronized using
their LF/PERIOD setting).

SYNC VPA

Up to three VPAs may be used (VPA1, 2 and 3). Each of these will always
start their measurements synchronously with all other VPAs. If mechanical
measurements are being performed, those will also be similarly

synchronized. If the unit is part of a multi-unit group then the
measurements will also be synchronized with any other unit which are also
configured with the SYNC VPA mode within that multi-unit group.
SPECTRUM

A single VPA may be used (VPA1) as for the SINGLE VPA selection, but
spectrum analysis is performed instead of a full harmonic analysis.

EN61000-3-2

A single VPA may be used (VPA1) as for the SINGLE VPA selection, but EUT
measurements are in accordance with EN61000-4-7 and assessments in
accordance with EN61000-3-2 are available.

EN61000-3-12 A single VPA may be used (VPA1) as for the SINGLE VPA selection, but EUT
measurements are in accordance with EN61000-4-7 and assessments in
accordance with EN61000-3-12 are available.
Caution:

Do not alter the measurement mode while performing an assessment to
EN50564, EN61000-3-2 or EN61000-3-12.

Recommendations:

Unless you specifically need one of the other modes, select the
SINGLE VPA mode.
The use of the SYNC VPA mode is only recommended when long or
widely different measurement periods are being used and the
signals are changing rapidly. In most multiple VPA applications it is
recommended to use the MULTI VPA mode with the same
measurement period configured in each and if necessary because of
changing signal levels use shorter measurement periods for better
synchronization of timing between VPAs and then include response
averaging as needed to stabilize the readings, this is particularly
recommended if the signals in the VPAs have widely differing
frequency content.

6.8.2

Configuring a VPA

The configuration shown on the screen shows the configuration for a selected VPA. The
CONFIG VPA button (not shown if only a single VPA is available) allows you to select which
VPA configuration is displayed.
Note: The settings on this screen only affect the selected VPA except as denoted below.
Selecting and Configuring VPA Channels
VPA Channels can be configured by using the buttons located in the CHANNELS area.
Channel Selection
If you press any of the available channel number buttons, that channel is toggled between
selected (button highlighted green) or unselected (not highlighted and colored grey).
Pressing the ALL button selects that all available channels are used in the selected VPA.
Note: Only channels that are installed are displayed.

M2000 SERIES OPERATION MANUAL
SECTION 6: FRONT PANEL OPERATION

As an aide, the channel type and current option for each channel is shown in the lower
portion of each of the channel number buttons as the two letter code.
Deselecting all channels from the selected VPA disables the selected VPA.
A channel can only be selected in a single VPA; selecting a channel in the selected VPA
deselects it in other VPAs automatically.
Caution:

Do not alter the channel content of a VPA while performing an assessment to
EN50564, EN61000-3-2 or EN61000-3-12.

Channel Scaling
Pressing any of the channel SCALE buttons allows you to configure that channel for voltage
scaling, current scaling and/or current offset.
Pressing the SCALE button next to the ALL button sets all selected channels to the same
scaling and offset settings.
If any scaling is configured to be applied to a channel then ON is shown in the SCALE button
for that channel and the button is highlighted, otherwise OFF is shown and the button is not
highlighted.
An example of the screen used to setup channel scaling is shown below.

Changes made in this screen are not used for measurements until the underlying MEAS
CONFIG screen is navigated away from.
Notes: If scaling is disabled for voltage and/or current, the scale factors and offset remain
saved in the unit for later reuse.
If the channel is subsequently selected in another VPA (or disabled by not selecting
it in any VPA), the channel scaling and offset settings stay with the channel.

SECTION 6: FRONT PANEL OPERATION

Voltage scale factors between 0.001 and 1000000 may be entered.
Current scale factors between 0.000001 and 1000000 may be entered.
Current offsets may be entered up to the maximum measurable for the current
input option and are the offset at the output of the transducer (as shown on the
screen).
The current offset is applied as a DC offset to current measurements. You should
not attempt to use it as a method to offset an unwanted AC signal content.
Channel Current Range Setting
Pressing any of the channel A RANGE buttons allows you to configure that channel for the
desired current range selection.
Pressing the A RANGE button next to the ALL button sets all selected channels to the same
current range selection.
Settings of HI, LO and AUTO may be available depending on the current option in each
channel.
Note: If set for AUTO then the text in the A RANGE button also indicates the present range
being used (LO or HI).
Recommendations:

For most applications, select the same current range for all channels
in a VPA.
When configuring an AD Type channel, use of the AUTO setting is
recommended for most applications. However, if the load has
rapidly and widely changing current or if the user is going to trigger
on an inrush current, then the HI range should be selected.
When configuring an AX Type channel, choose the range giving the
best compatibility with the type of transducer being used.
Generally, for A:V type transducers this will be the HI range and for
external shunts this will be the LO range.

Configuring VPA Measurements
Measurements are configured by using the buttons in the MEASURE area. Some of the
settings in this area are interdependent, you should start with the uppermost setting and
work downwards on the screen (all lower settings are forced to be consistent with higher
settings as needed).
Note: Depending on configuration and the installed channel types, some buttons may not
be present or may not allow modification of the setting.
Low Frequency Limit and Measurement Period
The LF/PERIOD button allows you to select the low frequency limit and measurement period
for the selected VPA if MEAS MODE is not EN61000-3-2 or EN61000-3-12.

M2000 SERIES OPERATION MANUAL
SECTION 6: FRONT PANEL OPERATION

Settings of VLF, LF, 10Hz/0.3s, 20Hz/0.1s, 45Hz/20ms, 150Hz/10ms and 500Hz/2ms are
available. Additionally, settings selecting a lower numbered VPA are available when MEAS
MODE is set for MULTI VPA or SYNC VPA and you are configuring VPA2 or VPA3.
Notes: This setting sets the nominal measurement period; the actual measurement period
will be automatically adjusted during operation to be the nearest integer number of
fundamental signal cycles as needed.
For the LF setting the measurement period is widely variable; 1 second for
frequencies above 1Hz and 1 cycle for frequencies below 1Hz.
For the VLF setting the measurement period is widely variable; 5 seconds for
frequencies above 0.2Hz and 1 cycle for frequencies below 0.2Hz.
Setting this to a lower numbered VPA forces all measurements in both VPAs to be
exactly synchronous (this is only available for VPA2 or 3). This configures the VPA
being configured to use the same LF/PERIOD setting of that VPA and also use the
fundamental frequency of that VPA.
Recommendations:

For typical applications, the 10Hz/0.3s or 20Hz/0.1s setting is
recommended.
For low power measurements to EN50564 and with a rapidly
changing load, the 45Hz/20ms setting should be considered. See
section 8.5 for full details regarding EN50564 measurements.

Fundamental Frequency Source
The FUND button allows you to select the source of fundamental frequency for the selected
VPA if MEAS MODE is not EN61000-3-2 or EN61000-3-12. The following settings are
available:
NONE

No fundamental frequency is used and harmonic analysis will not be
available.

FIXED

A further screen allows you to enter the frequency to use.

VOLTAGE or CURRENT Fundamental frequency will be measured using the selected signals
in this VPA. With either of these selections a further screen allows
you to enter the maximum frequency to measure.
MAINS

Fundamental frequency will be measured using the voltage signals
in this VPA. The measured frequency must be in the range 45 to
65Hz, if the signal frequency cannot be measured (or is outside of
this range) then the M2000 mains supply frequency is used.

AVIONICS

Fundamental frequency will be measured using the voltage signals
in this VPA. The measured frequency must be in the range 300 to
900Hz.

Other VPA

Fundamental frequency used for this VPA is automatically obtained
from that VPA in real time.

M2000 SERIES OPERATION MANUAL
SECTION 6: FRONT PANEL OPERATION

GFUND (1, 2 or 3)

Fundamental frequency used for this VPA is automatically obtained
from the M2000 VPA which has been programmed to provide that
GFUND measurement for this multi-unit group.

Recommendations:

For 50/60Hz applications the MAINS setting should be used.
For 400Hz applications the AVIONICS setting should be used.
When it is required to measure signals with a fundamental
frequency close to or above the maximum measurable frequency of
the channels in this VPA then select NONE.
If mainly the DC amplitude is needed, or no suitable fundamental
can be established from any signal and the AC content is primarily
over a few kHz, the NONE setting should be used.
When it is required to measure ripple on a DC supply at a specific
frequency or harmonics of it, either the FIXED or MAINS setting
should be used. For example, if mains ripple is to be measured then
set this to MAINS and set the HARMONICS setting to at least 1
(typically 10 or more), harmonic analysis will then show the
magnitude of the ripple at each harmonic of mains.
If the VPA being configured is making DC measurements but the
signals have significant ripple at a frequency related to that being
measured by another VPA, then setting that other VPA as the
source of the fundamental for this VPA may be used to reduce the
effects of that ripple and also enables you to use harmonic analysis
in the VPA being configured to measure the ripple content of the DC
signal.

Note: Lead/lag and all non-harmonic measurements are still available when no
fundamental can be measured. However, the measurement period cannot be
automatically adjusted to be an integer number of cycles of the signal AC content
(this has minimal effect if the signal frequency is primarily over a few kHz).
High Frequency Bandwidth
The BANDWIDTH button allows you to select any bandwidth limiting to use within the VPA
being configured if MEAS MODE is not EN61000-3-2 or EN61000-3-12. Available settings are:
AUTO-TRACK

The unit will automatically provide just enough bandwidth limitation to
have an insignificant effect on the measurements, as determined in real
time from the fundamental frequency and the HARMONICS settings.

UNFILTERED

There is no bandwidth limitation and the full capability of the channels is
available.

USER

You are also prompted to enter the desired -3dB bandwidth limitation.

Recommendations:

The AUTO-TRACK selection is recommended for most applications
unless a set bandwidth or no limit at all is specifically required by

SECTION 6: FRONT PANEL OPERATION

the application or if measuring frequencies close to or above the
maximum measurable frequency of the channels.
Note: If the bandwidth restriction is beyond the capabilities of a channel then no
bandwidth limitation is applied.
If you select AUTO-TRACK, you can return to this screen and see the actually applied
limit, which is displayed in the lower half of this button, e.g. AUTO (6k).
If you select AUTO-TRACK and NONE as the FUND setting, a fixed 500Hz bandwidth
limitation is used.
Harmonic Analysis Configuration
The HARMONICS button allows you to select the maximum number of harmonics to analyze
within the VPA being configured if MEAS MODE is not EN61000-3-2 or EN61000-3-12. This is
not available when MEAS MODE is set to SPECTRUM or if FUND is set to NONE.
Recommendations:

For most applications this should be set to 50 unless harmonic
analysis is not required in which case it should be set to 0. Only if
the specific application requires more harmonics is it recommended
to set this higher.
In modulated signal applications (such as motor drives) this should
be a low value and often a figure of 5 or less is used.

Notes: If this is set to zero (0), no harmonics will be analyzed in the VPA being configured.
Lead/lag and all non-harmonic measurements are still available when not
performing harmonic analysis.
In order to accurately measure very high-order harmonics the cycle-to-cycle jitter of
the signal frequency is of importance. To accurately measure 500 harmonics this
requires that the source have <0.025% frequency jitter. Mains supplies rarely
achieve this. If it is desired to measure high-order harmonics of an unstable
frequency source then it is recommended that you consider using spectrum analysis
instead.
The actual number of available harmonics is limited to half the bandwidth
limitation, and may be further limited by other settings and/or by the measured
fundamental frequency.
Spectrum Analysis Configuration
The SPECTRUM button allows you to enter the desired frequency resolution (in Hz) and
maximum desired frequency (in Hz) for the spectrum analysis. This is only available when
MEAS MODE is set to SPECTRUM.
Note: These settings have a major effect on the speed at which spectrum measurements
can be made. For optimal speed, use the largest possible frequency resolution and
the smallest possible ratio between the resolution and maximum frequencies.
The frequency resolution entry is limited to be within 0.01Hz to 1kHz

M2000 SERIES OPERATION MANUAL
SECTION 6: FRONT PANEL OPERATION

The maximum frequency entry is limited to between 100 and 16384 times the
frequency resolution.
Configuring VPA Measurement Result Displays
The measurement Results Display can be configured using the buttons in the DATA area.
Depending on configuration and the installed channel type, some buttons may not be
present or may not allow modification of the setting. Following settings are available:
Default Coupling
The COUPLING button allows you to select whether DC ONLY, AC ONLY or AC+DC results will
be shown as the primary data on the POWER DATA screens, and used for the calculation of
integrated data, and used for obtaining total values for the selected VPA.
Recommendation:

Unless only DC results are required, the AC+DC setting is
recommended.

Note: DC ONLY is not available if MEAS MODE is EN61000-3-2 or EN61000-3-12.
This does not restrict channel measurement data to the selected coupling; the
measurement results within a channel are generally available for all couplings.
Averaging
The RESPONSE button allows you to select that measurement results will be averaged over
time if MEAS MODE is not EN61000-3-2 or EN61000-3-12. Settings of FASTEST, MEDIUM,
SLOW and SLOWEST are available.
Recommendation:

The performance and specifications of the M2000 are not reliant on
the use of this capability; it should only be used when needed and
otherwise set to FASTEST.
When using results which are dependent on results from multiple
VPAs or from motor results then these results may not all be using
the same response averaging, which may result in inappropriate
results while the signals are changing. In these cases it is
recommended to use FASTEST for all response averaging settings.

Note: This setting can be used in combination with the DIGITS setting (see below) to
reduce the jitter in readings from unstable signals.
Max Displayed Digits
The DIGITS button allows you to select that all available measurement results will be
displayed with limited resolution if desired. Settings of 3, 4, 5 and 6 are available.
Recommendation:

In most applications, this should be set to 5 or 6. If there is
significant instability in the signals, this should be set to 3 or 4.

Note: This only affects displayed numerical results. It does not affect any measurements
obtained via an interface, via a historically saved record or via data logging.

V or A Terminal Burden Adjustments
The ADJUST button allows you to adjust results of each channel to compensate for either
the current drawn by the V terminals or for the voltage between the A terminals. The
labelling of each selection shows whether you need results at the source or at the load,
followed (in braces) by whether the V terminals of each channel are connected at the source
or the load.
NONE

No adjustments are performed, the results use the unadjusted
voltage and current signals.

SRCE(V@SRCE)

The V terminal current burden is added to the A signal. This should
be used when the V terminals are directly connected across the
source voltage (so the A terminals are measuring the load current)
and you wish to obtain the source results.

SRCE(V@LOAD)

then A terminal voltage burden is added to the V signal. This should
be used when the V terminals are directly connected across the load
voltage (so the A terminals are measuring the source current) and
you wish to obtain the source results.

LOAD(V@SRCE)

then the A terminal voltage burden is subtracted from the V signal.
This should be used when the V terminals are directly connected
across the source voltage (so the A terminals are measuring the load
current) and you wish to obtain the load results.

LOAD(V@LOAD)

The V terminal current burden is subtracted from the A signal. This
should be used when the V terminals are directly connected across
the load voltage (so the A terminals are measuring the source
current) and you wish to obtain the load results.

Recommendation:

In most applications this should be set to NONE; only if not using
external current transducers and either operating at low voltages
and high currents or at high voltages and low currents should this
be set for an adjustment to be applied.
See section 18 for full details regarding configuring this for
EN61000-3-2 and -12 measurements.

Note: Channels which have scaling applied ignore the ADJUST setting and their signals are
not adjusted.
Configuring how VPA Results are Combined
This is performed by using the buttons in the COMBINE area. Depending on configuration
and the installed channel types, not all buttons may be present and the COMBINE area itself
may not present.
Channel Wiring
The WIRING button allows you to select how measurements are combined and labelled
when producing total results for this VPA.

The selection must match the method used to wire the application to the power analyzer
channels in this VPA (see section 5.6).
Note: The available selections are determined from the number of channels selected in
this VPA. If the number of channels is changed, this setting will be reset to the N x
1ø setting (which is valid for any number of channels).
Power Efficiency and Loss
The EFF/LOSS button allows you to select how the total power of this VPA is included in
efficiency and power loss data. This button is not available if MEAS MODE is set to SINGLE
VPA or SPECTRUM.
The unit allows the total watts of a VPA to be included in one of three available data sets;
IN, MIDDLE and OUT power. Alternatively, the total power of this VPA can be excluded from
all three of these.
Note: If the unit is configured as part of a multi-unit group then the resulting IN, MID, OUT
power totals, power loss and efficiency results will include the total IN, MID and
OUT power measurements from all units within that multi-unit group.
6.8.3

The methods for performing this are fully described in 9, “USB Drive Usage” on page 208.
The measurement configuration can be imported from or exported to a binary file on an
external USB drive attached to the front panel USB port.
Notes: This file contains almost the entire configuration of the M2000 (measurements,
screens, harmonics limits, custom screen definition, and preferences). It does not
include the interface configuration or the POWER CTRL preference setting.
You can have an almost unlimited number of configurations available to you by
creating, exporting and importing them using a USB Drive in this manner.
Briefly, this is done using the following steps:
1. Insert the drive into the front panel USB port and wait for it to be READY.

The primary measurement results are shown using a large font and colored yellow-gold.
Caution:

If V and/or A signals have RMS values which are beyond the measurement
capability of the channel, the respective primary data is colored red. You should
ensure that the signals are within the capabilities of the channel and should
reduce the signal levels as soon as possible, otherwise the channel may be
damaged.

Whether the current is leading or lagging the voltage can be determined by the direction of
an arrow shown immediately after any PF data shown. If the arrow is pointing upwards then
the current is leading, if downwards then it is lagging.
The Watts, VA, VAR, PF, Volts and Amps results are grouped with their respective secondary
results.
The secondary results are shown in a smaller font and are colored white and these may
be disabled or enabled by pressing the DETAILED/BASIC Button. These include the
results for couplings other than that configured (for the example above, AC+DC is
configured as the COUPLING so the secondary results show the DC and AC data). DC PF
is never shown.
For COUPLED or RECTIFIED data the voltage and current group secondary data also
shows the most positive and most negative peak excursions, the difference between the
highest and lowest half-cycle peaks, and the crest factors (for COUPLED) or form factors
(for RECTIFIED).
If the signals have peaks which are beyond the measurement capability of the
channel, the respective peak data is colored red. This should not necessarily be
taken as a cause for concern, particularly if only temporary; it merely indicates that
the displayed results may not be fully accurate as they include ‘clipped’ signals.

Half-cycle peak data is not shown if the fundamental frequency cannot be
established or there are two or less cycles of the signal in a measurement period.
For FUNDAMENTAL data the voltage and current group secondary data also shows the
distortion including all configured harmonics as a percentage relative to the
fundamental.
The PHS data in the PF group secondary data is the inverse cosine of the PF data with
the polarity set from the lead/lag determination.
The frequency shown (if any) is the fundamental frequency obtained for this channel, from
the source configured by the FUND setting in the MEAS CONFIG screen for this channel.
If MEASURING is shown for frequency with no other measurement results, then this
indicates that the first measurement is being made with a new configuration. This is
temporary (unless measurements are held); as soon as the first measurement
results are available they will be shown.
If NO FUNDAMENTAL is shown for frequency, then this indicates that the signal
providing the fundamental frequency measurement (the FUND setting in the MEAS
CONFIG screen for this channel) is either not present or has not been measured yet
following a change to the measurement configuration.
If configured for LF or VLF measurements (by the LF/PERIOD setting in the MEAS CONFIG
screen for this channel) then a measurement progress bar is included in the lower right
corner of the data window.

Viewing Measurement Results for a VPA

The results for a VPA can be selected on the POWER DATA screen by pressing the Source
Select Button and then selecting the desired VPA. Only VPAs configured for measurement,
i.e. those containing at least one channel, can be selected.
For a VPA the Data Select Button allows the selection of a variety of data, each having a
slightly different layout. The layout also slightly varies with the WIRING configuration setting
for the VPA.
Coupled, Rectified and Fundamental Data
This data can be viewed by selecting the COUPLED, RECTIFIED or FUNDAMENTAL selection
in the Data Select Button. If the COUPLED selection is chosen, the button also shows the
configured COUPLING setting for this VPA (i.e. DC, AC or AC+DC).
This screen shows the mean Volts, mean Amps, total Watts, total VA, total VAR, total PF and
Frequency measurements for the selected VPA.

The primary measurement results are shown using a large font and colored yellow.
Caution:

If V and/or A signals have RMS values which are beyond the measurement
capability of the channel then the respective primary data is colored red. You
should ensure that the signals are within the capabilities of the channel and
should reduce the signal levels as soon as possible otherwise the channel may
be damaged.

The primary Watts, VA, VAR and PF data is the total data for the VPA.
The primary Volts and Amps data is the average for all phases/channels in the VPA.

Whether the current is leading or lagging the voltage can be determined by the direction of
an arrow shown immediately after any PF data shown. If the arrow is pointing upwards then
the current is leading, if downwards then it is lagging.
The Watts, VA, VAR, PF, Volts and Amps results are grouped with their respective secondary
results.
The secondary results are shown in a smaller font and are colored white and these may
be disabled or enabled by pressing the DETAILED/BASIC Button.
For all data the secondary results show the individual channel results for each channel in
the VPA.
For 3ø3w(2ch) and 3ø3w(3ch) WIRING settings the secondary voltages are the phase-tophase voltages and the primary voltage is the average of the three phase-to-phase
voltages.
For 3ø3w(2ch) and 3ø3w(3ch) WIRING settings the Wye voltage conversion is also
shown.
For 3ø4w WIRING setting the Delta voltage conversion is also shown.
Whether the current is leading or lagging the voltage can be determined by the
direction of an arrow shown immediately after any PF data shown. If the arrow is
pointing upwards then the current is leading, if downwards then it is lagging.
The PHS data in the PF group secondary data is the inverse cosine of the PF data with
the polarity set from the lead/lag determination.
The frequency shown (if any) is the fundamental frequency obtained for this channel, from
the source configured by the FUND setting in the MEAS CONFIG screen for this channel.
If MEASURING is shown for frequency with no other measurement results, this indicates
that the first measurement is being made with a new configuration. This is temporary
(unless measurements are held); as soon as the first measurement results are available
they will be shown.
If NO FUNDAMENTAL is shown for frequency, this indicates that the signal providing the
fundamental frequency measurement (the FUND setting in the MEAS CONFIG screen for
this channel) is either not present or has not been measured yet following a change to
the measurement configuration.
If configured for LF or VLF measurements (by the LF/PERIOD setting in the MEAS CONFIG
screen for this channel), a measurement progress bar is included in the lower right corner of
the data window.

1. Select which channel is shown by using the leftmost button. If this button colors RED
when pressed then this indicates that the presently selected channel is the only
channel configured.
2. Select whether voltage, current, watts or inter-phase voltage harmonics are shown
by using the VOLTS/AMPS/WATTS button. This button has a Vph-ph selection for
inter-phase voltage harmonics available if the selected channel is configured for
3p3w(3ch) or 3p4w measurements. The Vph-ph selection selects that the voltage
harmonics of the inter-phase voltage between the selected channel and the next
higher channel in the VPA will be shown (the voltage between the last and the first
channel is shown if the last channel is selected).
3. Select whether the selected voltage or current harmonics are to be compared
against limits by the LIMITS button. See below for details regarding applying
harmonics limits.
4. Select the format of the bar chart by using the fourth button. You may select linearly
or logarithmically scaled bar charts, either showing absolute data, or relative to the
fundamental, or relative to the total signal.
5. If a logarithmic format bar chart is selected then the fifth button allows you to select
how many decades are shown (1 through 5).
Notes: If no harmonics are available to show, the bar chart is blank and there are no
numerical listings on the left side. Also, a NO HARMONICS AVAILABLE is shown in
the chart. Typically, this indicates that one or more of these conditions:




The signal providing the fundamental frequency measurement (the FUND
setting in the MEAS CONFIG screen for this VPA) is not present
The selected channel is not configured for harmonics measurements (see
the FUND and HARMONICS settings in the MEAS CONFIG screen for this
VPA)
You have selected a relative chart and only the fundamental is available.

If the frequency is shown in orange, the harmonics are not locked closely enough to
allow accurate measurement of all configured harmonics.
The actual number of harmonic bars shown may be lower than the configured
setting due to the maximum harmonic frequency constraints for the selected
channel (dependent on the channel type, the actual fundamental frequency, and
the HARMONICS and BANDWIDTH settings on the MEAS CONFIG screen for the
selected VPA).
When showing watts harmonics the height of the bar is independent of the polarity,
the polarity is shown in the numeric harmonics listing to the left of the chart.
When showing inter-phase voltage harmonics, phase data is not available in the
numeric harmonics listing to the left of the chart.

Each harmonic is listed with the harmonic number, and also there is a gold colored bar
under the horizontal axis of the bar chart showing where the listed harmonics are located
on the bar chart.
There are two methods which can be used to scroll the numerical listing:
1. Using the scroll up/down buttons above and below the listing (these buttons repeat
if held pressed).
2. Pressing anywhere in the bar chart. This positions the listing in the harmonics shown
at that position on the bar chart. You may also drag the listing in this manner.
Notes: The amplitude data is in Volts or Amps or Watts or % units as set by the type of bar
chart selected.
The phase data is in degree units with ±180° range as follows:

Fundamental Voltage:

Relative to the V fundamental in the lowest
numbered channel of the VPA.

Non-fundamental Voltage:

Relative to the V fundamental in this channel.

Fundamental Current:

Relative to the V fundamental in this channel.

Non-fundamental Current:

Relative to the A fundamental in this channel,

The M2000 has the ability to compare voltage and current harmonics against limits set for
each harmonic independently for voltage and current.
If limits are enabled to be shown then:
 The bar chart includes a red line indicating the limit for each checked harmonic
 Colors the portion of any failing harmonic bar as red above the limit (the example
above shows this)
 Colors the numerical listing for each compared harmonic as either green (pass) or
red (fail) or white (not checked)
 Shows the overall pass/fail status in the LIMIT button (colored red or green)
In the example shown above, only the 2nd and 3rd harmonics have limits defined and the
3rd harmonic is failing.
Notes: When configured for EN61000-3-2 measurements, you can select any of the
classifications of EUT specified in the standard. The limits employed are, if needed,
calculated from the actual current, power and/or power factor measurements. This
is not a regulatory assessment, but may be used for informative purposes.
When configured for EN61000-3-12 measurements then you can select any of the
limits tables specified in the standard. The limits employed are calculated from the
actual current measurements. This is not a regulatory assessment, but may be used
for informative purposes.
Comparing Against User Limits
In order to compare harmonics against user limits (i.e. not regulatory limits) you must define
such user limits as follows:
1. Create the harmonic limit for each required harmonic.
a. This can be achieved by using the interface to command the limits directly
into the M2000,
b. Or, they can be exported from a M2000 which already has the harmonics
limits defined and then importing that file into this M2000 using a USB
drive.
c. Or, they can be imported from an ASCII file on a USB drive which has been
generated by you. See section 23.6.2 for details regarding this.
d. Note that this only needs to be performed once if the same set of limits is to
be used repeatedly. The M2000 internally saves the presently defined sets
of harmonic limits.
2. Once limits have been defined the M2000 always compares the measured
harmonics against these limits, you may select whether the bar chart and numeric
listing in the HARMONICS screen includes the results of those comparisons or not by
pressing the LIMIT button on the HARMONICS screen.

The displayed vectors and the corresponding numerical data are controlled by the two
buttons across the top of the screen (in order from left to right):
1. Selection of the channel or VPA for which to display the vectors.
2. Selection of the vector traces to show. The available selections are dependent on
whether a channel or a VPA is selected and if a VPA is selected then also the WIRING
configuration of that VPA. For each available traceA trace is enabled if the SHOW button is highlighted colored green. Pressing the SHOW
button toggles whether the trace is selected or not.
Pressing the COLOR button changes the color of that trace to the next available color, the
name of the trace being changed shows which color will be used for that trace and the

6.13 HISTORY Screen
The HISTORY Screen gives you access to charts of up to four measured results versus
elapsed time. All available data is always recorded without the user having to make
configuration settings. The only configuration needed is to select the data to display and to
format the display of this selected data. This has no effect on the recorded data. You may
select to display the same data on more than one trace, each with different scaling and
offset as desired.
The HISTORY Screen can be selected for view from any of the Main Data Screens by pressing
the HISTORY button.

Each trace is drawn showing the average and the extents of the data within each pixel. The
average is drawn with full brightness, while the extents are shown using a lower brightness
between the lowest and highest extents. The minimum and maximum measurements from
every individual measurement period is maintained, and for individual sample based data
such as peak this gives you continuous coverage of down to 1 μs resolution data in
perpetuity without data loss.
To the left of the chart there is textual information indicating the data selection, color,
scaling and offset settings for each enabled trace in a brief format.
Unless you have zoomed or stopped the chart, the right end of the chart is ‘now’ and the
left end is when the chart was started.
Note: If no traces are enabled to be shown on the chart, NO TRACES SELECTED is shown in
the chart.
You do not have to be viewing the HISTORY screen for data to be collected.
You do not have to start RUNNING unless you specifically stopped it.

Since all available historical data are always saved while RUNNING, you are free to
change traces at will without needing to retake data. You can also reconfigure
measurements at any time.
Traces are drawn in numerical order, trace 1 first, and then trace 2, etc. So the
highest numbered enabled trace is the uppermost trace if traces overlap.
6.13.1

Selecting and Configuration the Traces to Show

The HISTORY screen traces are selected and configured using the TRACES button at the top
of the screen. The example below shows the screen which is used to configure the traces to
be shown.

Pressing the SHOW button toggles the trace on/off. The button is highlighted colored green
when enabled. Change the color by repeatedly pressing the COLOR button until the adjacent
trace number shows the desired color. There are two, three or four buttons to the right of
the COLOR button which allow you to set the desired measurement data to trace. The
measurement data selected is the combination of these settings.
The button in the /DIV column allows you to set the scaling in the units of the selected
measurement data. Note that this is entered per division and there are a total of six vertical
divisions in the chart. This can also be set to the best 1/2/5 values to show all traces within
the extents of the chart when the AUTOSCALE button is pressed on the HISTORY screen.
The buttons in the OFFSET column allows you to set the measurement data value and the
place on the chart to position that value.
For example if a voltage trace was set for a 0.5A offset value and the offset set to
CENTER, then the resulting trace will be in the center of the chart vertically when it has
the 0.5A value, if higher than 0.5A then it will be higher (by an amount set by the scaling
required) and will be lower if below 0.5A.

Usually if you are plotting data that can be positive or negative and it is wished to set
the chart to cover the entire range of possible values, then you should set an offset of 0
at the CENTER, and set the scaling to ensure the trace stays within the 3 divisions on
either side of the center.
Usually if you are plotting data which is always positive (such as THD or CF for example)
and it is wished to set the chart to cover the entire range of possible values, then you
should set an offset of 0 at the BOTTOM, and set the scaling to ensure the trace stays
within the 6 divisions of the chart.
Usually if you wish to plot the deviation of data from some nominal expected value then
you should set that expected nominal value as the offset and set for the offset CENTER
location, and set the scaling as desired to make any deviations easily visible.
6.13.2

Changing the Time Display Mode

The TIME button (second from the left across the top of the screen) allows you to select
how times are shown on this screen. The follow settings are available:
TIME<-

Time is shown below the horizontal axis of the chart with zero (0) at
the right (corresponding to ‘now’) and the time at which the chart
was last started at the left with a negative time shown which
indicates the time before now.

TIME->

Time is shown below the horizontal axis of the chart with zero (0) at
the left - corresponding to when the chart was last started - and
‘now’ at the right with a positive time shown which indicates the
time since the chart was last started.

TIME

The actual time of day is shown.

TIME/DATE

The actual time of day and date are shown.

Note: The internal clock used to determine all history times relative to when it was started
is not the same clock as used to determine the displayed time of day and date.
There can be up to a few seconds per day difference between these.
6.13.3

Starting, Stopping and Restarting the History Chart

Normally the chart is always collecting measurement results. You may stop result collection
by pressing the RUNNING button, and then may start the chart from the beginning by
pressing it again (now labelled STOPPED). When starting, all previous historical data is
erased from memory. This button is highlighted colored green while the chart is running.
6.13.4

Prohibiting Data Collections Temporarily

While running a chart you can temporarily disable data collection by holding measurements,
see section 6.6.6. While measurements are suspended, the historical record still runs, but
the traces are blanked during this time.

6.13.5

Using Chart Cursor and Zooming

A vertically drawn cursor may be placed on to the chart by you. There are two ways of
achieving this:
1. Press the CURSOR button at the top of the screen, this places a cursor at the last
used position of the cursor, or at the left end of the screen if the cursor has not
been used before.
2. Press anywhere on the chart, this places a cursor at the horizontal position pressed.
You may drag the cursor in this manner and if dragged off the left or right edges of
the chart then it will also scroll the displayed timespan, or you may simply
reposition the cursor by pressing somewhere else on the chart.
The screen below shows an example of a HISTORY data screen with the cursor shown and
zoomed in.

When the cursor is shown, the following applies:







The CURSOR button is highlighted colored green
The time position of the cursor is shown above the cursor line
The cursor remains at the same pos
ition in time relative to the start of the data collection.
The textual data in the left side of the screen changes to show the maximum,
average and minimum data recorded for each trace in the time increment
corresponding to the width of one pixel at the present cursor position.
You may zoom the chart horizontally by pressing the ZOOM+ button (next to the
CURSOR button). While zoomed –
 You may zoom in further by pressing the ZOOM+ again, or may zoom back
by pressing the ZOOM- button.




6.13.6

The cursor remains set to the same time as it was prior to zooming, but it
may still be moved within the timespan of the zoomed chart by pressing at
the desired location within the chart.
 The cursor may be moved beyond the left and right ends of the timespan
being viewed by dragging it beyond those edges, in that case the cursor
remains at the edge and the chart timespan being shown is changed. This
enables you to ‘drag’ the timespan being viewed without having to zoom
back out.
 Each ZOOM+ press changes the horizontal timing by a nominal factor of 2:1
and a maximum of 10 zoom levels are allowed (i.e. the maximum zoom is
1000:1).
 When the chart is zoomed by the maximum factor the span of the zoom
changes to reflect that it is constrained to be a minimum of 1/1000th of the
overall history timespan however the cursor position remains the same.
Any zoom can be cancelled and the screen returned to the non-zoomed state
without a cursor at any time by pressing the CURSOR button while it is highlighted.
Rescaling the Chart Traces

Press the AUTOSCALE button to rescale all traces to the most optimum 1/2/5 scales (per
division) to maintain all traces just within the vertical extents of the chart. This action
changes the scaling for each enabled trace entered in the TRACES configuration but does
not alter the offset settings.
6.13.7

Exporting or Recording History Data

The method for performing this is fully described in section 9, “USB Drive Usage” on page
208. Historically saved measurements can be exported to a .CSV format textual file on an
external USB drive attached to the front panel USB port. This file contains all captured
measurements as configured for the traces on the HISTORY screen (without regard to the
scaling or offset configuration). The tabulated data covers 8192 equally spaced time
increments from the start of the history capture to the end of it and contains the maximum,
average and minimum of all measurements during each time increment.
Briefly, this is done using the following steps:
1. Insert the drive into the front panel USB port and wait for it to be READY.
2. Press the DRIVE INFO area of the screen, the screen shows the file export/import
screen.
3. Press the HISTORY button. The screen changes to allowing you to enter a file name.
4. Enter the desired file name (the extension is automatically provided).
5. If the file already exists, you are prompted to respond if you wish to overwrite it or
not.
6. The file is then written.
Alternatively, you can make a record of the HISTORY screen by saving an image of it to a
graphic file on an external USB drive attached to the front panel USB port.

6.14 SCOPE Screen
The SCOPE Screen can be selected for view from any of the Main Data Screens by pressing
the SCOPE button. There are actually two, totally independent SCOPE screens providing the
ability to use the M2000 as an oscilloscope:
CYCLE VIEW:
 Always shows a single fundamental cycle of the waveforms.
 Requires no specific configuration.
 Time resolution of the greater of 2.6ns or 1/512th of a cycle.
 You can view the volts, amps and/or watts signals for any channel and/or interphase voltage signals.
 You can view the same signal in multiple traces, each with different vertical scaling
and offsets.
 You can auto-scale the traces to ensure they fit on the chart.
 Allows up to 6 traces to be simultaneously viewed.
 Perfect for the inspection of periodic waveforms with extreme amplitude and time
detail available.
SCOPE VIEW:
 A multi-channel digital oscilloscope with many enhancements.
 Up to 12 channels (volts, amps and/or watts signals in each channel) and/or interphase voltage signals, up to six viewable at a time.
 You can change traces and/or trace scaling without having to retrigger.
 All data captured with full 22/24 bit resolution so you can change traces and/or
trace scaling without having to retrigger.
 You can auto-scale the traces to ensure they fit on the chart.
 You can show the same signal in multiple traces, each with different vertical scaling
and offsets.
 User configurable trigger and timebase.
 Cursor with timebase zoom capability.
 Can automatically remove any configured HF filtering and select the HI current
range during the scope capture and then replace the original settings after
completion of the capture, perfect for current inrush measurements.
 Continuous or single trigger.
 Perfect for capturing non-periodic waveforms and transients (such as inrush current
for example).
Which screen is viewed is selected by the upper left button of the SCOPE screen. The
presently selected screen view name is displayed in the button, which toggles every time it
is pressed.
Note: You do not have to be viewing a SCOPE screen for signals to be captured.

Viewing Periodic Waveforms – CYCLE View Screen

The above example shows a 200kHz sinewave voltage (in blue) and an almost in-phase
triangle wave current (in red) and includes a third trace (in green) which is also of the
current waveform, but scaled and offset for close inspection of the peak of the triangle
wave. Note that this chart provides <10ns time resolution (there are 512 pixels across the
chart) and also note how the use of vertical scaling and offset can be used to show very fine
amplitude details. This is an actual screen image obtained from a M2000 measuring actual
signals, it has not been altered except to scale it to fit on this page. This was obtained using
a W type channel card which nominally samples at just under 1MSPS so this image shows
the impact of the advanced sampling method provided by the unit and also demonstrates
how inaccurate it is to state that the sampling rate affects the bandwidth.
If no fundamental harmonic is available then the chart is blank and NO FUNDAMENTAL is
displayed in the chart. Cycle view places every sample in a measurement period at the
correct phase in the displayed chart to build a single cycle formed from all cycles present
during the measurement period. To do this it needs the results of the harmonic analysis to
position the samples correctly and it needs to know the fundamental frequency. Since the
M2000 always ensures that every cycle of the signals are sampled at different phases within
them, a complete high-resolution image of a single cycle is obtained using the actual
samples of the actual signals.



If no traces are enabled to be shown on the chart then NO TRACES SELECTED is
displayed on the chart and the chart is blank.
If the period is shown colored orange, the unit is not locked closely enough to allow
an accurate representation of the signals.

You can press the AUTOSCALE button to rescale all traces to the most optimum 1/2/5 scales
(per division) to maintain all traces just within the vertical extents of the chart. This action
changes the scaling for each enabled trace entered in the TRACES configuration.
Configuring Scope Traces
The only scope related configuration selects the traces, trace color, scaling and offset for
each. This is done by pressing the TRACES button. An example of the screen which allows
configuration of the traces is shown below.

All traces must be from the same VPA, so the required VPA must be selected prior to
selecting any traces. For each trace:








Pressing the SHOW button toggles the trace on/off. The button is highlighted
colored green when enabled.
Change the color by pressing the COLOR button until the adjacent trace number
shows the desired color.
There are two buttons to the right of the COLOR button which allows you to select
the channel and signal to trace. Either the voltage or current or watts signals or the
inter-phase voltage signals may be traced. The watts signal is the result of
multiplying the voltage and current signals.
The button in the /DIV column allows you to set the scaling in the units of the
selected signal. Note that this is entered per division and there are a total of 6
vertical divisions in the chart (3 above and 3 below the centerline). This can also be
set to the best 1/2/5 values to show all traces within the extents of the chart when
the AUTOSCALE button is pressed on the CYCLE VIEW screen.
The button in the OFFSET column allows you to set the signal level which will
correspond to the centerline of the chart.

Note: Traces are drawn in numerical order, trace 1 first, and then trace 2, and so on. So
the highest numbered enabled trace is the uppermost trace if traces overlap.
If a VPA is configured to a LF/PERIOD setting of another VPA then selecting either
VPA will allow the signals in either VPA to be selected.
Exporting or Recording Cycle View Data
The methods for performing this are fully described in section 9, “USB Drive Usage” on page
208. The CYCLE VIEW data can be exported to a .CSV format textual file on an external USB
drive attached to the front panel USB port. This file contains a tabulation of the points in
each CYCLE VIEW waveform for all channels in a selected VPA.
Briefly, this is done using the following steps:
1. Insert the drive into the front panel USB port and wait for it to be READY.
2. Press the DRIVE INFO area of the screen, the screen shows the file export/import
screen.
3. Press the CYCLE DATA button. The screen changes to allowing you to enter a file
name.
4. Enter the desired file name (the extension is automatically provided).
5. If the file already exists, you are prompted to respond if you wish to overwrite it or
not.
6. If configured for more than a single VPA, you are prompted to select the VPA for
which to export the cycle view data.
7. The file is then written.
Alternatively, you can make a record of the CYCLE VIEW screen by saving an image of it to a
graphic file on an external USB drive attached to the front panel USB port.
Briefly, this is done using the following steps:
1. Insert the drive into the front panel USB port and wait for it to be READY.
2. Display the screen to be recorded.

SECTION 6: FRONT PANEL OPERATION

Pressing the SOURCE button allows you to select the trigger source from the available
signals.
Note that the scope always captures all signals in the channels configured in the same VPA
as that of the trigger source. If a VPA is configured with its LF/PERIOD setting selecting as
another VPA and the trigger source channel is in either of these VPAs, then channels may be
in either of these two VPAs.
Pressing the TYPE button allows you to select the trigger detection type:
DC (rising edge)

The scope is triggered when the selected signal changes from below
the trigger level to above the trigger level. Automatic HF filtering is
provided to reduce the possibility of small glitches causing a trigger.

DC (falling edge)

The scope is triggered when the selected signal changes from above
the trigger level to below the trigger level. Automatic HF filtering is
provided to reduce the possibility of small glitches causing a trigger.

ABS(DC)

The scope is triggered when the selected signal is above the trigger
level or below the negative of the trigger level. This setting is
particularly useful when triggering on inrush currents or voltage
transients because you do not know which polarity the transient will
be. Automatic HF filtering is provided to reduce the possibility of
small glitches causing a trigger. Note that setting this trigger type
and a trigger level of zero (or close to zero) will cause the scope
capture to always trigger as the signal is always either above or
below zero.

HF

The scope is triggered when the result of HP filtering the selected
signal is above the trigger level or below the negative of the trigger
level. This setting is useful when it is required to trigger on fast
glitches. The HP filter employed corresponds to a time of nominally
10% of the timebase setting. Note that setting this trigger type and
a trigger level of zero (or close to zero) will cause the scope capture
to always trigger as the signal always has greater than zero HF
content.

Recommendations:

For viewing repetitive signals. Either the DC (rising edge) or DC
(falling edge) selections should be made.
For viewing a current inrush or startup event. The ABS(DC) selection
should be made.
For viewing fast transients. The HF selection should be made.

Pressing the LEVEL button allows you to select the trigger detection level in the units of the
signal.
For the ABS(DC) or HF trigger types only positive values can be used and you should not
enter a trigger level of zero, as the signal will always trigger.
Pressing the POSITION button allows you to set where the trigger position is located on the
unzoomed chart.

You may select 0%, 25%, 50% or 75%.
Pressing the TIMEBASE button allows you to select the timebase in units of time per division
similarly to an oscilloscope.
Timebase settings between 5us and 20s per division are available.
Pressing the CAPTURE MODE button allows you to choose whether the scope capture will be
performed normally (NORMAL setting) or optimized for inrush capture (INRUSH setting).
When configured for the INRUSH setting the following changes are made –
While a capture is being performed all D current option channels which are unscaled have
the HI current range forced. After capture of the scope trace this is released back to the
configured current range.
While a capture is being performed any BANDWIDTH setting in the MEAS CONFIG
screen is ignored and the captured signal will not be bandwidth limited by that setting.
After capture of the scope trace this is released back to the configured setting.
After a capture is obtained the cursor is automatically turned on and positioned at the
maximum signal of trace 1. This enables direct readout of the maximum inrush current
(for example).
Recommendation:

The INRUSH capture mode is recommended for performing inrush
current measurements. This enables the use of the optimal MEAS
CONFIG settings for normal power measurements while still
allowing accurate measurement of inrush currents. Although this
can be used with continuous triggering, this is primarily intended for
use with single triggered captures. The example configuration
shown above shows a typical configuration for inrush current
capture, with trace 1 configured as showing the current signal. See
also section 14 for full details regarding inrush measurement and
capture.

Configuring Traces
This is performed by pressing the TRACES button. An example of the screen which allows
configuration of the traces is shown below. Changing traces does not clear any previously
made scope capture; it only affects how it is displayed.

Change the color by pressing the COLOR button until the adjacent trace number
shows the desired color.
There are two buttons to the right of the COLOR button which allows you to select
the channel and signal to trace. Either the voltage or current or watts signals or the
inter-phase voltage signals may be traced. The watts signal is the result of
multiplying the voltage and current signals.
The button in the /DIV column allows you to set the scaling in the units of the
selected signal. Note that this is entered per division and there are a total of 6
vertical divisions in the chart (3 above and 3 below the centerline). This can also be
automatically set to the best 1/2/5 values to show all traces within the extents of
the chart when the AUTOSCALE button is pressed on the CYCLE VIEW screen.
The button in the OFFSET column allows you to set the signal level which will
correspond to the centerline of the chart.

Traces are drawn in numerical order, trace 1 first, and then trace 2, and so on. So the
highest numbered enabled trace is the uppermost trace if traces overlap.
Performing a Scope Capture
The oscilloscope may be run in either SINGLE or CONT modes similarly to a normal
oscilloscope. Pressing the CONT button starts continuous oscilloscope captures.

While capturing in CONT mode the button is colored green and is labelled RUNNING.
Shortly after triggering and capturing all signals, the scope will wait for another trigger
event. While capturing in CONT mode you may press the CONT button to stop capturing
signals, or may press the button to its right to make a SINGLE mode capture instead.
Pressing the SINGLE button starts a single oscilloscope capture.
While capturing in SINGLE mode the button is colored green. After triggering and
capturing all signals, the scope will stop. While capturing in SINGLE mode you may press
the SINGLE button to abort the capture, or may press the CONT button to initiate CONT
mode instead.
While capturing, the SINGLE button is labelled with the status of the scope signal capturePRETRIG. Indicates that the scope is collecting sufficient signal to accommodate the
configured trigger position.
WAITING. Indicates that the scope is waiting for a trigger event.
TRIG’D. Indicates that the scope is collecting the signals after a trigger event has been
detected but there is not enough signal captured to fill the screen yet.
Recommendations:

The BANDWIDTH setting for the VPA also bandwidth limits all
signals for the scope. This can limit your ability to use the HF trigger
type if set for a fast timebase. If you intend to use the HF trigger
type to detect very fast glitches on a much lower frequency signal
then it is recommended to configure the VPA measurements for an
BANDWIDTH setting of UNFILTERED. If using the INRUSH capture
mode then the BANDWIDTH is ignored during the scope capture.
The actual -3dB bandwidth of the captured signals is displayed
below the chart.
If the intention is to trigger on an inrush event, then the use of the
ABS(DC) trigger type is recommended, using the current signal as
the trigger source and setting the trigger level to a suitable current
level which you expect the inrush current to exceed. Typically
SINGLE captures are used for inrush capture.
If the intention is to trigger on a mains supply surge then the
ABS(DC) trigger type is recommended, using the voltage signal as
the trigger source and setting the trigger level to a suitable voltage
level just above the peak level of the highest expected normal mains
voltage. Typically CONT mode is used for mains supply surge
capture as this enables the unit to detect another surge without
user intervention.
If the intention is to trigger on mains supply ‘glitches’ then the HF
trigger type is recommended, using the voltage signal as the trigger
source and setting the trigger level to a voltage level just high
enough to not trigger on whatever glitches are normally present.

SECTION 6: FRONT PANEL OPERATION

Typically, CONT mode is used for mains supply glitch capture as this
enables the unit to detect another glitch without user intervention.
For capturing repetitive signals then the use of the DC(rising) or
DC(falling) trigger types is recommended, however you should also
consider using CYCLE VIEW as this provides better trace resolution
in time and requires no configuration.
Just as for all digital sampling oscilloscopes, setting the timebase to
a very long value and attempting to capture a higher frequency
signal will cause aliasing in the captured data making the captured
signal look like it has a much lower frequency than it actually has.
The unit has an internal scope capture depth of 32768 samples. You
should always set an appropriate timebase considering the
frequency of the signal expected.
Note: Since the scope view capture is intended for the capture of non-repetitive signals it
gains no advantage from the advanced sampling system in the unit and scope view
data has the time resolution of individual samples of the signals. For W channel
types this is just over 1μs, otherwise it is just over 4μs.
Viewing a Scope Capture

The last taken scope capture is shown with the traces selected and configured as described
above. To the left of the chart is a listing of the configured traces. Below the chart is a
textual description of the trigger configuration.
Notes: If no signals have been captured then NO DATA CAPTURED is displayed on the chart
and the chart is blank.

SECTION 6: FRONT PANEL OPERATION

If no traces are enabled to be shown on the chart then NO TRACES SELECTED is
displayed on the chart and the chart is blank.
You may change the trace selections as required without having to capture further
data. All signals within the VPA are always captured with full resolution, allowing the
trace colors, the trace signals, or the trace scaling and offset to be altered at will
after the capture.
The scaling for the traces may be altered to ensure the best fit on the chart by pressing the
AUTOSCALE button on the SCOPE VIEW screen. When pressed, the unit changes the
configured scaling to the optimum 1/2/5 scaling to just maintain each trace within the
extents of the chart.
Using the Cursors
A vertically drawn cursor may be placed on to the chart by you. There are three ways of
achieving this:
1. Pressing the CURSOR button at the top of the screen, this action places a cursor at
the last used position of the cursor or at the trigger position if the cursor has not
been used before.
2. Pressing anywhere on the chart, this action places a cursor at the position pressed.
You may drag the cursor in this manner, or may reposition the cursor by pressing
somewhere else on the chart.
3. Using the INRUSH capture mode. This automatically places a cursor at the maximum
signal of trace 1.
The screen below shows the capture of an inrush current zoomed in on the initial inrush
peak.

When the cursor is shown:

The CURSOR button is highlighted colored green
The time position of the cursor is shown above the cursor line
The textual data in the left side of the screen changes to show the signal level
captured for each trace at the time of the present cursor position.
You may zoom the chart horizontally by pressing the ZOOM button; when pressed
you are prompted the select the zoom timebase. While zoomed:
 When the ZOOM button is pressed the cursor position is centered in the
screen.
 The ZOOM button is highlighted colored green.
 The cursor remains set to the same time as it was prior to zooming, but it
may still be moved within the timespan of the zoomed chart by pressing at
the desired location within the chart.
 The cursor may be moved beyond the left and right ends of the timespan
being viewed by dragging it beyond those edges, in that case the cursor
remains at the edge and the chart timespan being shown is changed. This
enables you to ‘drag’ the timespan being viewed without having to zoom
back out.
Any zoom can be cancelled and the screen returned to the non-zoomed state
without a cursor at any time by pressing the CURSOR button while it is highlighted.
Exporting or Recording Scope View Data

The methods for performing this are fully described in section 9, “USB Drive Usage” on page
208. The SCOPE VIEW data can be exported to a .CSV format textual file on an external USB
drive attached to the front panel USB port. This file contains a tabulation of the points in
each SCOPE VIEW waveform for all channels.
Briefly, this is done using the following steps:
1. Insert the drive into the front panel USB port and wait for it to be READY.
2. Press the DRIVE INFO area of the screen, the screen shows the file export/import
screen.
3. Press the SCOPE DATA button. The screen changes to allowing you to enter a file
name.
4. Enter the desired file name (the extension is automatically provided).
5. If the file already exists then you are prompted to respond if you wish to overwrite it
or not.
6. The file is then written.
Alternatively, you can make a record of the SCOPE VIEW screen by saving an image of it to a
graphic file on an external USB drive attached to the front panel USB port. Note that the
trigger configuration and any bandwidth limitation are included on the screen, enabling
these to be included in the recorded image.
Briefly, this is done using the following steps:
1. Insert the drive into the front panel USB port and wait for it to be READY.
2. Display the screen to be recorded.

6.15 STBY POWER Screen
The STBY POWER Screen gives you the ability to configure, start/stop, and view the results
of low power measurements in accordance with EN50564:2011. The use of this screen is
detailed in section 8.6.

6.16 ACCES EUT Screen
The ASSESS EUT Screen gives you the ability to configure and perform EUT assessments
compliant with EN61000-3-2 or -12. The use of this screen is detailed in section 8.6.

6.17 SPECTRUM Screen
Normally the M2000 is used for general power analysis and harmonic analysis purposes, but
in some situations it may be desirable to perform spectrum analysis on the signals instead of
harmonic analysis.
This is only available if the M2000 is configured for spectrum analysis by the MEAS MODE
setting on the MEAS CONFIG screen.
An example of this is for measuring distortion in accordance with some avionics
specifications which require a spectral analysis to be performed with 20Hz resolution for
frequencies up to 150kHz (note that this maximum frequency requires W channel types as it
is above the 115kHz upper limit for L, S or A channel types). The M2000 can be configured to
measure the spectrum of all signals at the same time to this requirement.
Note:
SPECTRUM mode is a single VPA mode; only one VPA can be used in spectrum analysis
mode. You do not have to be viewing the SPECTRUM screen for spectrum data to be
measured.
When configured for spectrum analysis, the unit still performs normal power analysis
(unchanged) and also harmonic analysis (but limited to the fundamental component).
The M2000 is a single measurement DFT based spectrum analyzer, not a ‘scanning’ type.
There are two phases to a spectrum analysis:
MEASURING

During this phase all signals are sampled and these samples are collected.
This phase is one period of the user set resolution frequency in length (for

M2000 SERIES OPERATION MANUAL
SECTION 6: FRONT PANEL OPERATION

example if the frequency resolution is set for 1Hz then this phase takes 1
second).
PROCESSING

After collecting the samples during the MEASURING phase the M2000 then
processes these samples by DFT analysis to produce the desired spectrum.
There is no measurement performed for spectrum analysis during this
phase. Once this phase is completed, the results are available for display (or
export to a file) and a new MEASURING phase is started.

There is only a single MEASURING sample collection phase and only a single PROCESSING
phase per spectrum analysis update cycle. The analysis of every spectral point analyzed is
performed on the same set of samples in its entirety so there are no discontinuities in the
analyzed results.
6.17.1

Configuring Spectrum Analysis

Spectrum Analysis is configured by you making the following changes to the normal
configuration on the MEAS CONFIG screen:



Set the OPERATING MODE to SPECTRUM
Set the desired SPECTRUM frequency resolution and maximum frequency.

All other settings on that screen are as previously described.
6.17.2

Optimizing Spectrum Measurement Configurations

The Power Analyzer performs both the power analysis and spectral analysis at the same
time. In most cases, you do not need to consider the compromises involved in this, but if
you wish to perform spectrum analysis with a frequency resolution less than the inverse of
the power analysis measurement period, then consider whether to optimize for the
spectrum analysis rather than for the power analysis. An example of this would be
performing power analysis with a 0.1 second measurement period and spectrum analysis
with a 1Hz frequency resolution (so having a 1 second MEASURING period).
This is because when the frequency resolution is set to a low value the MEASURING period
for the spectrum analysis spans several power analysis measurement periods, so any
changes required due to measurements made in power analysis will interfere slightly with
the spectrum analysis being performed. If the MEASURING period is less than that of the
power analysis measurement period then these recommendations do not need to be
considered typically. There are two points which need to be considered:
1. Range changes could occur because of power analysis measurements if using D
current option channels and they are configured with A RANGE set for AUTO. If it is
possible that a range change could occur while performing low frequency resolution
spectrum analysis then it is recommended that the AUTO A RANGE setting is not
used.
2. To ensure that the sampling frequency of the signals is not an exact multiple of the
fundamental or any harmonics of the actual signals during power analysis, the
actual sampling frequency is slightly modified in ‘real-time’ to prevent this. These

SECTION 6: FRONT PANEL OPERATION

slight changes in the sampling frequency slightly broaden the effective bandwidth of
the spectrum analysis results. If you wish to have the best performance for
spectrum analysis when using a low frequency resolution and also using a high ratio
between the resolution and maximum frequencies then it is recommended to use a
FIXED FUND setting for power analysis (or a NO FUND setting) which prevents this
from occurring.
6.17.3

Holding Measurements while Performing Spectrum Analysis

Measurements can be held and released as described in section 6.6.6. If a measurement
hold is imposed during the MEASURING phase of spectrum analysis, the measurement being
collected is abandoned and the displayed spectrum remains at that last shown.
If a measurement hold is imposed during the PROCESSING phase of spectrum analysis then
the processing continues and the results of this processing will subsequently be displayed
when this phase completes, but any further measurements will not be performed until the
measurement hold is released.
6.17.4

Viewing Spectrum Analysis Results

When operating in SPECTRUM mode, the HARMONICS screen button shown on the right
side of most screens is replaced by a SPECTRUM button. Pressing this button enables the
results of the spectrum analysis to be viewed on the SPECTRUM screen.

If the spectrum takes more than nominally ½ second to perform either phase of the analysis
then a status bar is displayed (as shown on the example screen above) which indicates the
percentage completion of the MEASURING phase and the PROCESSING phase as
appropriate.
The CHANNEL button allows you to select which channel you are viewing the spectrum of.

M2000 SERIES OPERATION MANUAL
SECTION 6: FRONT PANEL OPERATION

The VOLTS/AMPS/WATTS button allows you to select which signal in the selected channel
you are viewing the spectrum of.
The CURSOR button allows you to turn on/off a moveable cursor which allows you to obtain
a numerical reading of the spectrum content at a specific frequency. If shown, the cursor
may be moved one pixel to the left or right by using the <- and -> buttons, or you may drag
the cursor on the screen by pressing within the chart area.
Notes: The settings on this screen only affect which spectrum is displayed; all spectra are
obtained independently of the settings on this screen.
When a cursor is shown, the unit automatically detects the highest signal content
within the range of frequencies covered by the single pixel at which the cursor is
positioned, displaying the frequency and amplitude of that maximum signal. If no
measured frequency falls within the cursor position pixel then it finds the largest
spectral content at the adjacent frequencies that have been measured.
When displaying a WATTS spectrum, the chart shows a plot of the absolute value of
watts at each frequency point.
6.17.5

Exporting or Recording Spectrum Data

The methods for performing this are fully described in section 23.
The SPECTRUM data can be exported to a .CSV format textual file on an external USB drive
attached to the front panel USB port. This file contains a tabulation of all frequency points
for all channels.
Briefly, this is done using the following steps:
1. Insert the drive into the front panel USB port and wait for it to be READY.
2. Press the DRIVE INFO area of the screen, the screen shows the file export/import
screen.
3. Press the SPECTRUM button. The screen changes to allowing you to enter a file
name.
4. Enter the desired file name (the extension is automatically provided).
5. If the file already exists then you are prompted to respond if you wish to overwrite it
or not.
6. The file is then written.
Alternatively, you can make a record of the SPECTRUM screen by saving an image of it to a

Measurements Terminology
This section establishes definitions for various measurements that can be performed with
the power analyzer which our used throughout this manual.

7.1

Phase References

Measurement results for individual wiring phases are denoted by the use of phase letter
labels. The use of these labels depends on the WIRING configuration setting. All
measurement results given for an individual wiring phase are denoted as follows:

7.2

Phase Reference

Description

øA, øB, øC, or øD

Data obtained from the 1st, 2nd, 3rd or 4th channels in a VPA
respectively; for 3ø3w(2ch) WIRING this is only used for current results
and the øC data is that obtained from the combination of the øA and øB
data.

A, B, C, or D

Data obtained from the 1st, 2nd, 3rd or 4th channels in a VPA
respectively (only when a VPA is configured for N x 1ø WIRING).

øAC

Data obtained for voltage or power results between øA and øC; for
3ø3w(2ch) WIRING this is the data from the 1st channel in the VPA,
otherwise between the 1st and 3rd channels in a VPA (voltage only).

øBC

Data obtained for voltage or power results between øB and øC; for
3ø3w(2ch) WIRING this is the data from the 2nd channel in the VPA,
otherwise between the 2nd and 3rd channels in a VPA (voltage only).

øAB

Data obtained for voltage results between øA and øB (i.e. the 1st and 2nd
channels in a VPA, not used when a VPA is configured for N x 1ø WIRING).

N

Data obtained for Neutral current as measured from the combination of
the channels in a VPA (only when a VPA is configured for 2ø3w or 3ø4w
WIRING).
Table 7-1: Phase Reference Definitions

Leading or Lagging Indication

Whether the current is leading or lagging the voltage is
indicated by the direction of an arrow shown
immediately after most PF data displays. If the arrow is
pointing upwards () then it is leading, if downwards
then it is lagging ().
For an individual channel, lead/lag is determined from
the phase of the fundamental current (if available) or
by analysis of the signals by computing the power result obtained by using a delayed current
signal (if no fundamental is available).
For a VPA total, this is determined from the polarity of the sum of the channel VAR results.

Note: There are no minimum signal levels for leading/lagging detection. The indication is
valid at all signal levels.

7.3

Peak and Valley Results

There are several types of peak measurement results available from the power analyzer:

7.4

Highest Peak

This is denoted on the unit’s screens by Pk followed by an up arrow and
is the highest sampled signal during each measurement period.

Lowest Peak

This is denoted on the unit’s screens by Pk followed by a down arrow
and is the lowest sampled signal during each measurement period.

Peak

This is denoted on the unit’s screens by Pk and is the largest (i.e.
without regard to the polarity) sampled signal during each
measurement period.

Peak-to-Peak

This is denoted on the unit’s screens by PkPk and is the result of
subtracting the lowest peak result from the respective highest peak
result.

Valley Peak

This is denoted on the unit’s screens by Vly and is established as follows:
The largest of all samples obtained for each signal - without regard to
the polarity - within every half-cycle of the fundamental period is
recorded; the smallest -. without regard to the polarity - of these
recorded half-cycle samples within each measurement period is
recorded as the signal valley measurement results. This measurement
result is only available if the fundamental frequency is known and the
measurement period contains at least two fundamental cycles.

Peak-Valley

This is denoted on the unit’s screens by Pk-Vly and is the result of
subtracting the valley result from the respective peak result and so is a
measurement of the peak-to-peak modulation of each signal as
determined over each measurement period. This measurement result is
only available if the fundamental frequency is known and the
measurement period contains at least two fundamental cycles.

Individual Channel Results

All measurement results given for an individual channel are the results for that channel,
without regard to the WIRING configuration of the VPA in which the channel is configured.

Phase Results

All phase measurement results are given in degrees using either a -180° to +180° or a 0° to
360° range as defined by the preferences menu setting (see 6.7.2.6).
In many situations, the mathematical definition of phase is used, i.e. if a phase ø21 is
returned for signal S2 with respect to signal S1, then signal S2 is mathematically S2.sin(ωt +
ø21) and S1 is S1.sin(ωt). However, it is not uncommon in some industry segments to use a
“delay” based definition of phase as illustrated by the drawing shown below.

In this drawing, the signal ‘2’ may be referred to as having a 120° phase relationship to
signal ‘1’ and signal ‘3’ as having a 240° relationship to signal ‘1’, whereas mathematically

they are sin(ωt + 240°) (=sin(ωt - 120°)) and sin(ωt + 120°) (=sin(ωt - 240°)) respectively. In
the M2000, this is described as a “Delay” based phase rather than the “Math” based phase.
The unit supports several methods of showing phase results as selected by a preference
setting (see 6.7.2.6) which affects ALL phase results. There are three parts to this preference
setting, as follows:
e) Numeric Range. You can select that phase results are shown with a -180 to +180°
range or a 0 to 360° range. Note that these are mathematically equivalent, e.g.
sin(ωt - 120°) is the same as sin(ωt + 240°).
f)

Math or Delay Basis. You can select whether a mathematical basis or a delay basis is
used for phase results as described above. This affects the mathematical use of
results and it affects all phase results, e.g. sin(ωt - 120°) is NOT the same as sin(ωt +
120°) so if the Delay preference for phase is selected then you must include the
polarity reversal in any mathematics which you might want to perform on the
results.
a) Using a Math setting - if a phase of ø is shown then mathematically the
signal is S.sin(ωt + ø).
b) Using a Delay setting - if a phase of ø is shown then mathematically the
signal is S.sin(ωt – ø).

g) CW or CCW vectors. You can select whether the VECTORS polar chart (see 12.8) is
shown in a clockwise (CW) or counter-clockwise (CCW) direction for positively
increasing phase after incorporating the basis above. Note, only the way in which
phase is graphically shown is altered by this.
7.7.1

Non-Harmonic Phase Results

Non-harmonic phase for a channel or for a VPA is the inverse cosine of the respective PF
using the lead/lag determination to determine the polarity of the result. In some industry
segments this is named effective or apparent phase.
7.7.2

Harmonic Phase Results

Fundamental Voltage

Phase is relative to the V fundamental in the lowest
numbered channel of the VPA.

Non-fundamental Voltage

Phase is relative to the V fundamental in the selected

8.2

Optimizing Low-Level DC Performance

If you are only using measurements configured as AC (i.e. not DC or AC+DC) or the AC levels are
significantly higher than any expected DC levels (e.g. more than 30:1 higher), then low level DC
performance is not required and this section can be ignored.
8.2.1

Internal DC Zero Adjustment

The power analyzer automatically checks the internal DC offset if the ambient temperature
changes significantly and then applies any changes as needed. The automatic tracking of
temperature can be disabled by selecting OFF for the AUTOZERO setting in the PREFERENCES
screen. In this case, the user should occasionally perform this Internal DC Zero operation
manually.
Manual DC Zero operation is achieved by pressing the SYS CONFIG button from any main screen
and then pressing the INTERNAL button in the DC ZERO area. The unit will perform an Internal
DC Zero operation and save the adjustments recorded. A screen will show the progress of the
operation and will wait for you to press the RETURN button on that screen once the action has
been successfully completed.
Recommendations:

If AUTOZERO has been set to OFF, it is recommended to perform this
Internal DC Zero operation at least daily, or whenever the environment
has changed by more than ± 2 °C from that in which it was last
performed.
If AUTOZERO has been set to ON but the unit is in a significantly
different environment than in which it was calibrated, there will be a
few minutes after turning on the unit while the DC zero function is
tracking the change in environment. To reduce this small shift during
the first few minutes of operation, you may wish to perform an Internal
DC Zero operation in the normally used environment. Otherwise there is
no need to perform this operation.

Note: This operation takes a few seconds and does not require that signals be removed from
the input terminals. This operation only affects channels that are configured for use.
While performing the Internal DC Zero, DO NOT send any configuration interface
commands to the unit.
8.2.2

External DC Zero Adjustment

If you are using external current transducers or shunts (AX Card Type) that may have significant
DC offset in their output, you can perform an External DC Zero operation to set those offsets to
the presently measured values. This external DC zero operation can also be used to account for
any external DC offsets (leakage currents or thermally induced voltages) or to adjust any
remaining offsets in the power analyzer caused by adverse conditions (e.g. nearby heat sources
and/or unusual placement or orientation of the unit).
This differs from the Internal DC Zero described above as it corrects for any externally applied
DC offset. Thus, you must ensure that there are no DC signals present on the input terminals of
the unit that should not be compensated for.

M2000 Series Power Analyzers Operation Manual

Page 144 of 284

M2000 SERIES OPERATION MANUAL
SECTION 8: APPLICATION SPECIFIC MEASUREMENTS

This is accomplished by pressing the SYS CONFIG button from any main screen and then pressing
the EXTERNAL button in the DC ZERO area. You are then shown a screen which requests that
you select whether to adjust the DC offset for all channels (ALL), or only those configured for
scaling (ONLY SCALED), or to abort the action (NO). After you select the desired choice, the unit
will immediately use the latest obtained DC measurements and apply them as DC offsets. If no
channels were affected by this operation, a message is displayed for a short time. If the
measured DC values were too large to be adjusted, a message to this effect is displayed for a
short time and no adjustments are made.
Recommendation:

If it is desired to use this external DC zero ability when AUTOZERO is set
to OFF, it is recommended to first perform an internal DC zero
operation. Ensure that valid measurement results are available by
returning to any of the measurement results screens. Also check that
the readings being indicated are those expected before returning to the
SYS CONFIG screen and performing the external DC zero operation.

Note: This takes very little time and has an immediate effect. Channels that are not configured
are not affected by this action.
8.2.3

Using an AX Card Current Input at Low Levels

The AX Type card current inputs have a resolution of 1μV or lower when used with an external
current shunt. To achieve this level of performance, the user must be aware of thermally
induced DC voltages which can occur both within the shunt itself and in the wiring between the
shunt and the terminals of the power analyzer. The user can reduce these effects by using high
quality wiring and connectors, and balancing the two sense wires by using the same gages and
lengths while using the same connector types, and routing the two wires together. In severe
circumstances, this can also be affected by air currents passing over the shunt or the wiring, so
you may need to take precautions to prevent unwanted airflow over them.
Recommendations:

Twisting together the two sense wires from the shunt to the unit’s
terminals both reduces these thermal voltage affects and also reduces
the inductive pick-up of AC current in these wires and is highly
recommended. You should also note that the use of thinner gage wiring
(e.g. 26awg or thinner) will produce the best thermal voltage
performance as thinner wiring does not allow significant heat transfer
through it.
The use of coaxial cable is not recommended as often the two
conductors are not of the same material.
Even when all precautions are taken, there will typically be several
micro-volts of thermally induced offset voltages. The regular use of the
External DC Zero capability described above is highly recommended
when using shunts.

8.3

Startup or Inrush Current Measurements

The M2000 provides several methods for performing measurements of Inrush or for device
startup. Which method is chosen is up to you, as each has its merits. It is assumed in this section
that you are conversant with the general operating methods used in the M2000. This section is

M2000 SERIES OPERATION MANUAL
SECTION 8: APPLICATION SPECIFIC MEASUREMENTS

specifically provided to describe two methods for measuring Inrush currents; however it may
equally be applied for other device startup measurements.
Usually the measurement configuration suitable for inrush measurement is not the same as that
used for ‘normal’ power measurements. This often results in errors being made in either the
inrush measurement or in normal power measurements as often these required configuration
changes are forgotten or improperly made:


Inrush measurements are generally performed with no bandwidth restrictions whereas
normal power measurements may have a restricted bandwidth.



Inrush measurements typically need to be performed on the HI range of any current
channel, whereas normal power measurements use the most optimal range of current
measurement for the normal current levels of a device.

8.3.1

Obtaining a Graphical and Numerical Inrush Current Measurement

This first method described requires no specific configuration changes to the MEAS CONFIG
screen in order to perform an inrush measurement as any changes required will be
automatically applied.
This has the advantage of being an easily repeatable measurement. The measurement is not
dependent on remembering to re-configure for inrush measurements (and remembering to
reverse that later). The configuration of the SCOPE can typically be left at the settings for the
inrush measurement so they do not need to be changed. Also, none of these settings have any
significant impact on the inrush measurement itself, only how it is displayed.
For details regarding using the SCOPE screen, see section 6.14.
The example screen below shows a SCOPE screen used for this purpose. It contains an inrush
current measurement result. In this case, voltage was continuously applied to the input
terminals. The power switch of the device being tested was used to apply the power inrush. This
can also be achieved by turning on and off the voltage source used.

SECTION 8: APPLICATION SPECIFIC MEASUREMENTS

1. Turn off the device under test. It does not matter if the voltage is switched off between
the power analyzer and the EUT (so the voltage is always present at the unit) or at the
supply to the device and the unit (so the voltage is not initially present at the unit).
Typically, a device should have power removed for some period of time before reapplying power for a meaningful inrush measurement (often several minutes).
2. Configure the Scope capture for the inrush measurement as shown in the example
screen below.

This example uses channel 1 as monitoring the power to the device being tested – any
channel configured for measurements can be used.
This example shows a 100mA trigger level being used. This is a typical trigger level to use
for this purpose. However, some devices being tested may draw more than this when
turned off. In those cases, this level should be increased above the current level drawn
by the device while turned off (or consider switching the source of the power rather
than using the device power switch).
This example shows 20ms/division as the time base and the trigger position will be at
the 25% position on the screen –resulting in the final screen having 40ms shown before
the trigger event and 120ms afterwards. You can select a different time base as required
if the inrush event is known to be shorter or longer. The 25% trigger position is
recommended for this type of measurement.
The CAPTURE MODE selected is INRUSH. This setting tells the power analyzer to
automatically ignore any bandwidth limitation provided by the existing BANDWIDTH
setting and also to force the use of the HI range of any unscaled AD Card type channels
while the inrush capture is in progress. After the capture has been made, these settings
will automatically revert to those configured.
3. Configure the traces to be shown on the screen. The screen below shows an example of
two traces configured to be captured (current and voltage). As shown here, it is useful
to include the supply voltage as a trace. This allows you to inspect the supply voltage to

SECTION 8: APPLICATION SPECIFIC MEASUREMENTS

see if it was being significantly disturbed by the inrush surge current and so having an
impact on the inrush current measurement. Trace 1 must be the signal that will measure
the inrush current. The other traces can be any signals which are also desired to be
captured.

For each trace, the following applies:








Pressing the SHOW button toggles the trace on/off. The button is highlighted colored
green when enabled.
Change the color by pressing the COLOR button until the adjacent trace number shows
the desired color.
There are two buttons to the right of the COLOR button that allow you to select the
channel and signal to trace. Either the voltage, current or watts signals may be traced.
The watts signal is the result of multiplying the voltage and current signals. All traces
must be in channels configured in the same VPA as that in which the trigger source
channel is configured.
The button in the /DIV column allows you to set the scaling in the units of the selected
signal. Note that this is entered per division and there are a total of 6 vertical divisions in
the chart (3 above and 3 below the centerline). This can also be set after the capture has
been made to the best 1/2/5 values to show all traces within the extents of the chart
when the AUTOSCALE button is pressed on the SCOPE VIEW screen. This only affects
how the trace will subsequently be displayed and so can be changed afterwards.
The button in the OFFSET column allows you to set the signal level that will correspond
to the centerline of the chart. This only affects how the trace will subsequently be
displayed and so can be changed afterwards. For this type of measurement this is
typically set to zero.

4. Press the SINGLE button to initiate an inrush capture. The unit will now wait until an inrush
event is detected by the current exceeding the trigger level set above, as shown by the
SINGLE button label changing to WAITING.
5. Apply power to the device.

6. The power analyzer screen will detect the current inrush and capture the signals as shown
on the screen.
a. The screen will have a cursor which is automatically set to the position of the maximum
inrush current, and the numerical data to the left of the chart will show the signals at
the cursor position so the trace 1 data shows the maximum inrush current.
b. You may re-scale the traces vertically to properly show them on the screen if you wish.
This is best accomplished by pressing the AUTOSCALE button which will automatically
adjust the display scaling so that the traces optimally fit on the chart.
c. You may zoom in to show more detail horizontally surrounding the inrush event by
pressing the ZOOM button and selecting a zoom time base which is faster that the time
base used for the capture.
d. You may move the cursor by dragging it across chart. Pressing the CURSOR button
repositions the cursor at the maximum inrush event position.
8. The above may be repeated as many times as you wish without requiring any action other
than pressing the SINGLE button and then re-applying power to the device.
9. Any other screen may be viewed after the inrush capture is completed. The MEAS CONFIG
settings were re-activated and so all power measurements are as they were configured. This
screen is still available though and can be returned to later.
8.3.2

Obtaining a Numerical Inrush Current Measurement

Before performing the inrush measurement in this manner, you must ensure that the present
MEAS CONFIG screen settings are compatible with performing such a measurement. Then
replace the ‘normal’ power measurement configuration settings afterwards.
The power analyzer must be configured with an UNFILTERED setting for BANDWIDTH, or
alternatively with a specific frequency bandwidth limit.
All AD Type current channels that will be used for this inrush current measurement should be
configured for the HI A RANGE selection.
Having checked that the unit is correctly configured, prepare to make the inrush measurement.
The example screen below shows the POWER DATA screen which will be used for this purpose.

SECTION 8: APPLICATION SPECIFIC MEASUREMENTS

Proceed as follows:
1. Turn off the device being tested. It does not matter if the voltage is switched off between
the power analyzer and the device (so the voltage is always present at the input) or at the
supply to the unit+ device (so the voltage is not initially present at the unit). Typically, a
device should have power removed for some period of time before re-applying power for an
inrush measurement (often several minutes).
2. Select the POWER DATA screen and configure it to show the desired channel or VPA (the left
button across the top of the screen) and select to show the INRUSH data (the middle button
across the top of the screen). The screen will look similar to that shown in the example
above.
3. Press the CLEAR button on this screen. This will clear any previously made inrush
measurements and the screen will show the highest measurements with the device being
tested unpowered (so should be very small current and power). If an inrush measurement is
being repeatedly made to ensure that the worst case measurement is made then you can
skip clearing the previous results, in that case the results shown will only be updated if an
inrush measurement exceeds those previously made.
4. Apply power to the device.
a) The screen will be updated to show the highest data recorded since it was last cleared.
b) The Apk and A data are the most important results shown for this type of testing,
showing the highest peak current and highest single measurement period RMS current
respectively. These provide you with the measurement of the peak current surge and a
measure of the short-term RMS current surge (which is typically much lower than the
peak surge).
c) The Vpk, and V data shows the highest peak voltage and highest RMS voltage
respectively. This is typically not particularly important for inrush current
measurements, but if it shows very high voltages then this could indicate that the supply

has excessive overshoot when recovering from the surge current so it might not be
suitable for this type of testing.
d) The W data shows the highest single measurement period power surge. Typically this is
not used for inrush applications.
Note: The measurements obtained for inrush are not affected by the RESPONSE setting for the
VPA.
If it is desirable to perform normal power measurements after performing inrush measurements
using this method, do not forget to return to the MEAS CONFIG screen and re-apply the original
settings if any were changed to perform the inrush measurement.
8.3.3

Recording Inrush Data

The methods for performing this are fully described in section 9, “USB Drive Usage” on page
208. Whichever method is used to obtain the inrush measurement, the resulting data can be
recorded by saving an image of the screen showing the results to a graphic file on an external
USB drive attached to the front panel USB port.
Briefly, this is done using the following steps:
1. Insert the drive into the front panel USB port and wait for it to be READY.
2. Display the screen to be recorded.
3. Press the DRIVE INFO area of the screen, the screen shows the file export/import
screen.
4. Press the SCREEN IMAGE button. The screen changes to allowing you to enter a file
name.
5. Enter the desired file name (the extension is automatically provided).
6. If the file already exists then you are prompted to respond if you wish to overwrite it or
not.
7. The file is then written.
If the inrush waveform was captured using the SCOPE VIEW screen, that data can be exported to
a .CSV format textual file on an external USB drive attached to the front panel USB port. This file
contains a tabulation of the points in each SCOPE VIEW waveform for all channels.
Briefly, this is done using the following steps:
1. Insert the drive into the front panel USB port and wait for it to be READY.
2. Press the DRIVE INFO area of the screen, the screen shows the file export/import
screen.

Data Integration

The power analyzer can provide integrated results, for example AHr, WHr, VAHr etc. This section
describes how to configure integration and how to start and stop integration.
It is assumed that you are conversant with the general operating methods used in the M2000 as
described in section 6 on page 65.
Integrated data measurement results can be viewed using the POWER DATA screens as
described in section 6.9.1(for individual channel results) or 6.9.2 (for VPA total results).
Notes: You do not have to be viewing integrated data for data to be integrated.
Integrated results do not only provide the total integrated data but also provide bought,
sold, charge and discharge integrated data as follows:




8.4.1

Bought integrated data includes only data while the channel or VPA has positive
Watts and is only available in VPAs that are not configured for DC ONLY COUPLING.
Sold integrated data includes only data while the channel or VPA has negative Watts
and is only available in VPAs that are not configured for DC ONLY COUPLING.
Charge integrated data includes only data while the channel or VPA has positive DC
Amps and is only available in VPAs that are configured for DC ONLY COUPLING.
Discharge integrated data includes only data while the channel or VPA has negative
DC Amps and is only available in VPAs which are configured for DC ONLY COUPLING.
Configuring Integration Data

You may configure for manually controlled integration or for automatically time controlled
integration by pressing the Integration Info area when not performing integration. The START
button on this screen makes any changes immediately active and starts integration.

To manually control starting and stopping of any integration, select MANUAL as the METHOD
setting on this screen.

When configured in this manner, after manually starting the integration sequence the
configured delay period is performed after which the automatically timed integration is
performed.
Note: The delay can be configured to a zero time.
You can still stop integration manually at any time.
You can configure the delay time using the START DELAY button and the desired run time using
the INTEG TIME button. These are both configured in the same general manner:
1 In the data entry screens for the START DELAY and INTEG TIME settings there are four
entries, one for each unit of days, hours, minutes and seconds.
2 The screen always starts with the days data selected; you can jump to any of the four
time units directly by pressing the respective time entry area.
3 You can enter a numeric between 0 and 99 into any of the four screens. The actual time
used is the total time created by combining all four data with their respective units.

EN 50564 Low Power Measurements

The STBY POWER Screen gives you the ability to configure, start/stop, and view the results of
low power measurements in accordance with EN50564:2011. It is assumed in this section that
you are conversant with the general operating methods used in the M2000 as described in
section 6.
The STBY POWER screen can be selected for view from any of the Main Data Screens by pressing
the STBY POWER button.

The power analyzer has the ability to perform low power measurements independently in each
VPA, so a single M2000 can perform up to three independent low power measurements. You
select which VPA is being configured, controlled and viewed by using the VPA button (upper left
corner of the display).
The unit performs the low power measurement in accordance with EN50564:2011 para. 5.3.2,
which is the recommended method for all low power measurements.
If you prefer a measurement according to EN50564:2011 para. 5.3.3 (“Average reading
method”) or 5.3.4 (“Direct meter reading method”), these can be accommodated using the
POWER DATA screen with the VPA properly configured and - as needed - using the Integration
capabilities of the M2000 described elsewhere in this manual. The STBY POWER screen should
generally not be used for these methods, but note that the method employed in the STBY
POWER screen to EN50564:2011 5.3.2 is “the recommended approach” and “should always be
used if there is any doubt regarding the behavior of the product or stability of the mode”.
Note: The word “sampling” in EN50564:2011 relates to sampling of the individual
measurement period results of the unit, not to the sampling of the signals used to
perform each such measurement.

VPA Measurement Configuration for EN50564:2011 Mode

There are some settings in the MEAS CONFIG screen that the user should ensure are
appropriate for performing EN50564:2011 compliant measurements. These are not enforced by
the power analyzer to allow you more flexibility in using this type of measurement.
All settings on the MEAS CONFIG screen not listed here do not affect how low power
measurements are performed to EN50564:2011.
Notes: The RESPONSE configuration setting for the VPA is not applied to the STBY POWER
results.
The COUPLING configuration setting for the VPA is not applied to the STBY POWER
results (all STBY POWER results use AC+DC coupling as required by EN50564:2011).
Although allowed by the unit, it is not recommended to reconfigure a VPA during a low
power measurement.
The MEAS CONFIG screen shown below gives an example of a fully EN50564:2011 compliant
configuration of the M2000 when the power source and load are connected via a LPA-1
connection accessory.

The M2000 performs one “sample” every measurement period, so to strictly accommodate the
requirement of EN50564:2011 para. 5.3.2, there must be at least one sample per second the
VPA must be configured for a LF/PERIOD setting of either 10Hz/0.3s, 20Hz/0.1s or 45Hz/20ms.
Recommendation:

Generally, the 20Hz/0.1s setting is recommended for LF/PERIOD which
exceeds the requirement by a factor of 10:1; however for shorter low
power measurements, or where the load is known to have fast
excursions in power, the 45Hz/20ms setting should be considered.

SECTION 8: APPLICATION SPECIFIC MEASUREMENTS

EN50564 measurements are normally performed on mains power.
Recommendation:

Generally, the MAINS setting for FUND is recommended

BANDWIDTH Setting
EN50564:2011 para. 4.4.2 requires power measurement be made with “a frequency response
exceeding 2KHz”.
Recommendation:

Generally, the AUTO-TRACK setting for BANDWIDTH is recommended
which fully meets this requirement.

HARMONIC Setting
EN50564:2011 para. 4.3.2 requires limits on the THD of the voltage source and requires that this
THD shall be computed using up to and including the 13th harmonic.
Recommendation:

The setting should be at least 13 for HARMONICS.

Note: The reported voltage THD on the STBY POWER screen only includes up to the 13th
harmonic no matter what HARMONICS is set to as long as it is set to at least 13.
ADJUST Setting
EN50564:2011 Appendix D requires that the error introduced by the shunt be accounted for in
the total error figures or be otherwise compensated for. EN50564:2011 Appendix B discusses
two methods of connecting the power analyzer and the load.
Recommendation:

It is recommended that the “Lower Power Loads” connections described
in EN50564:2011 B.4.2 (which is the method when using accessory LPA1) is always used. Use a setting of LOAD(V@SRCE) for ADJUST to
compensate for this wiring method.
The small inaccuracy of the compensation is included in the reported
error figure.

Low Power Measurement Configuration

The low power measurement itself is configured by pressing the CONFIGURE button on the STBY
POWER screen.

The recommended settings are as follows:
METHOD
The M2000 can perform two types of measurement as defined by EN50564:2011 para. 5.3.2.
These are set as EN50564 5.3.2a and 5.3.2d for the METHOD setting and relate to the first and
fourth methods described in EN50564:2011 para. 5.3.2 respectively, i.e. the methods for
measuring “power consumption within a mode is not cyclic…” (5.3.2a) and “Modes that are
known (based on instructions for use, specifications or measurements) to be of limited
duration…” (5.3.2d).
Note: The use of the wording “not cyclic” in EN50564:2011 can be confusing. It does not mean
that the load does not vary; it simply means that any variation does not have a known
and constant frequency of variation.
Recommendation:

In almost all circumstances the 5.3.2a setting should be used.

DATALOGGING
The DATALOG button allows you to select if the power analyzer is to automatically start and
stop data logging when a low power measurement is started and stopped.
Recommendation:

Typically this is not used, so this is set to NO.
For correct operation when set to YES, the data logging should already
have been configured to use manual timing (with no delay and less than
a 1 second interval) and with the desired data being logged (at least the
Watts result is recommended).

TEST TIME (EN50564:2011 5.3.2A)
If you selected the EN50564 5.3.2a method then the TEST TIME section is shown on the screen
with a button which allows you to set the minimum test time for the measurement.
Notes: For strict compliance to EN50564:2011 para. 5.3.2, the low power measurement should
be performed for a minimum of 15 minutes and should not be completed until the slope
obtained by linear regression of the power during the final 2/3rd of the total period is
less than that allowed by EN50564:2011.
For convenience where strict adherence to the standard is not required, the unit
allows the user to configure a total period of other than 15 minutes.
The unit will automatically extend the total period if the slope during the final 2/3rd
of the elapsed time does not achieve the maximum required and will not
automatically stop the measurement until this is achieved and the minimum period
has also been achieved, but you may manually stop the measurement at any time.
If the measurement is stopped by the user rather than automatically stopped to the
requirements of EN50564:2011 this is shown by denoting that the measurement
was “STOPPED” rather than “COMPLETED” on the screen.
In the data entry screens for the TEST TIME setting there are four entries, one for each
unit of days, hours, minutes and seconds.
The screen always starts with the days data selected; you can jump to any of the
four entries directly by pressing the respective time entry area.
You can enter a numeric between 0 and 99 into any of the four entries. The actual
time used is the total time created by combining all four entries with their
respective units.
When the ENT button is pressed the selected time unit area automatically changes
to next entry to the right, unless the seconds entry is selected when the action is
same as pressing the overall RETURN button.
START/STOP DETECTION LEVELS (EN50564:2011 5.3.2D)
If you selected the EN50564 5.3.2d method, the MODE DETECT section is shown on the screen
with two buttons which allows you to set the power levels at which the specific product mode
will be detected as starting and ending. These levels are in Watts and the unit will detect the
start condition as soon as the measured power level exceeds the START setting, and will
automatically stop the measurement when measured power level drops below the END setting.
Note: You may also manually stop the measurement, and by setting an END level of 0.0W and
a START level of 0.0W then effectively the measurement period will be totally manually
controlled.

Performing a Low Power Measurement and Viewing the Results

You can START and manually stop a low power measurement by pressing the START button
(which is labelled STOP while a measurement is being performed). This controls low power
measurements in all channels within the selected VPA.
Notes: For strict accordance with EN50564:2011 para. 4.3, the voltage source to the device
being measured may need to be a regulated power source with limits on the voltage
level and stability, frequency value and stability, voltage crest factor and voltage
distortion. It is possible that the local mains supply meets these requirements, but this is
often not the case. Also, the EN50564:2011 requirements for voltage level and
frequency are often overridden by other standards, usually calling for EN50564:2011
measurement of power and imposing limits on the measurement result, but which are
specific to local supply voltages or frequencies different to those defined in
EN50564:2011.
The M2000 maintains a record of the voltage level, frequency, voltage crest factor and
voltage THD during a low power measurement and reports the range of these
measurements encountered during the measurement, and also reports if any of the
crest factor or THD requirements are exceeded by coloring the data red if those
EN50564:2011 requirements are exceeded, but the unit does not stop a low power
measurement nor otherwise prevent the user from recording the final measurement
result.
You do not have to remain on the STBY POWER screen during the measurement. The
measurement will automatically progress whether this screen is being displayed or not.
The measurement hold capability of the M2000 is not applied to the STBY POWER
results.
The following data is shown in each of the results areas on this screen, listed in order from top
to bottom in each area. Except for the total measurement time, all data is for the last 2/3rd of
the measurement time if configured for EN50564 5.3.2a method or for the entire measurement

generating a report that is in strict conformance to the requirements of EN50564:2011 para. 6 is
required, this can be achieved by simply exporting an image of the STBY POWER screen after the
completion of the measurement and pasting it in a report along with the additional (nonmeasurement related) requirements of EN50564:2011. This exceeds the requirements of

Testing Compliance to IEC Harmonics Emissions Standards

The M2000 can perform EUT testing for full compliance to EN61000-3-2 or EN61000-3-12 mains
supply harmonics emissions standards. The method by which you may perform this is described
in this section.
The standards referenced in this section are licensed, copyrighted material and cannot be
reprinted, even in part, in this manual. Throughout this section, it is assumed that you have
access to the applicable IEC standards.
It is further assumed that you are conversant with the general operating methods used in the
M2000 as described in section 6 of this manual.
Making a compliance assessment of a EUT to the requirements of EN61000-3-2 or -12 can only
be performed from the front panel of the M2000 and does not require the use of a computer.
The assessment results can be recorded to a USB drive attached to the unit in CSV format. Any
screen images can also be saved in BMP format for recording purposes. This USB drive can be
transferred to a computer and a report document generated as needed.
If preferred, the M2000 may be configured for EN61000-4-7 measurements by configuring the
measurement mode of the unit to either EN61000-3-2 or -12 and the measurements can be
obtained via an interface that allows you to perform compliance testing via an interface with
suitable computer software that implements the assessment requirements.
In some situations, you may be required to make measurements of results such as THC without
actually performing an assessment of the EUT. Generally, this is a requirement in the standards
that is to be performed by a EUT manufacturer to predetermine the EUT conditions under which
to provide formal assessments of the EUT undertaken by a testing agency. In these situations
you should configure the M2000 for the applicable measurement mode (EN61000-3-2 or -12)
and use the HARMONICS screen to view the actual “real-time” THC measurement result while
changing the EUT conditions. You can record this result by saving an image of the applicable
HARMONICS screen from the power analyzer to a USB drive, which also contains the actual
harmonics. You should also consider that the supply source and wiring between the supply
source, M2000 and the EUT may affect these results so generally should be in accordance with
the standard requirements. In these situations, only sections 8.6.1.1 and 8.6.2 may have
relevance to you.
When configured for EN61000-3-2 or -12 measurement modes, the majority of the functions
and measurement availability in the M2000 are unchanged. The changes, necessary due to the
requirements of EN61000-4-7, are as follows:



The fundamental frequency range, the measurement bandwidth, the measurement
period, the number of harmonics, and the response filtering are all set according to
EN61000-4-7 and cannot be altered.

The FREQ SPEED preference setting is ignored.
The 3ø3w(2ch) WIRING configuration is not available.

current 5th harmonic phase is relative to the voltage fundamental rather than to the
current fundamental as it is usually reported by the power analyzer.
Certain power analyzer activities can be performed while in these modes but must not
be performed while an assessment is in progress The measurement mode must not be changed.
 The channel content of VPA1 must not be changed.
 The Internal and External DC Zero capability in the SYS CONFIG screen must not
be used.
 A scope capture using the INRUSH Capture Mode must not be performed.
Standards Compliance

When performing assessment testing to the requirements of the EN61000-3-2 and -12, you are
often performing a legal regulatory requirement. As such, you may need to be in possession of
justification showing that the measurement results are compliant. This section assists you with
that justification and provides information which may be of general use to you regarding these
assessments.
Power Supply and EUT Wiring
Both EN61000-3-2 and -12 contain requirements on the wiring between the supply source and
the EUT, including the power analyzer’s current measurement. You must ensure that the supply
source and the wiring meet these requirements.
In EN61000-3-2 see Figures A.1 and A.2
In EN61000-3-12 see clause 7.2 and note that the impedance of this wiring forms part of the
calculations regarding the value of Rsce, which is defined and referenced in many clauses of
EN61000-3-12.
Voltage Connections and ADJUST Setting
The wiring used for the voltage terminal connections carry very little current and are not
covered by any standard requirements. This wiring only needs to have sufficient insulation
rating for the voltage being carried and impedances as high as several ohms have virtually no
effect on the measurement results.
EN61000-3-2, -12, and EN61000-4-7 all require that you connect the voltage terminals of the
power analyzer across the voltage supply directly at the EUT. The M2000 allows you to do this,
and if you have done so, it also allows you to adjust the measured current to that of just the EUT
by correcting the apparent current signal for the current drawn by the voltage terminals of the
power analyzer. This is selected by selecting an ADJUST setting of LOAD(V@LOAD) in the MEAS
CONFIG screen.
Notes: For the ADJUST settings other than NONE, the setting is shown in two partsThe 1st part (LOAD or SRCE) defines where the results are to be shown for. In these
cases it is always the EUT load which is required so only the LOAD selections are
applicable.
The 2nd part (V@LOAD or V@SRCE) defines where the voltage measurement is
connected to. If connected to the supply source then V@SRCE should be selected,
otherwise the voltage measurement is connected to the EUT so V@LOAD should be
selected.

M2000 Series Power Analyzers Operation Manual

Page 165 of 284

M2000 SERIES OPERATION MANUAL
SECTION 8: APPLICATION SPECIFIC MEASUREMENTS

Recommendations:

For EUT loads of over 1Arms per phase you should follow the standards
and wire the voltage measurements to the voltage supply at the EUT
and also you should use the LOAD(V@LOAD) ADJUST setting.
For EUT loads between 0.05Arms and 1Arms per phase you are
recommended to use whichever wiring method is the most convenient
for you and select the applicable LOAD(V@LOAD) or LOAD(V@SRCE)
ADJUST setting. At these power levels, for a single phase supply and
EN61000-3-2 testing, it may be more convenient to use the LPA-1
adaptor available for the M2000 (which is wired with the V terminals on
the supply side) and use a ADJUST setting of LOAD(V@SRCE). If you use
the voltage measured at the supply source method then you must
ensure that the wiring to the EUT (including the M2000 current shunt) is
less than 0.1Ω (which is usually easily achieved).
For a EUT loads of below 0.05Arms per phase it is highly recommended
to use the V terminals connected to the supply source method (which
includes the LPA-1 adaptor) as it provides superior accuracy assuming
that the wiring between the supply source and the EUT (including the
M2000 current shunt) is less than 1Ω (which is usually very easily
achieved). The NONE ADJUST setting is recommended but
LOAD(V@SRCE) can also be used.

Multi-Phase Supplies without a Neutral
When using a multi-phase supply with no neutral, EN61000-4-7 suggests using an artificial
neutral resistive network to produce the common voltage measurement reference point, this is
not necessary with the M2000 as the voltage terminal impedance itself effectively provides such
a network.
Repeatability Requirements
Both EN61000-3-2 and -12 require that an assessment meet a repeatability requirement. For
EN61000-3-2 this is contained in clause 6.2.3.1 and in EN61000-3-12 it is contained in clause
4.2.3. In both cases it is required that better than 5% of the limit is achieved in the repeatability
of measurement of average individual harmonic currents, but it is stated in the standards that
this is not a requirement for assessment, but is a requirement for the selection of the
assessment time.
The repeatability of the M2000 itself is far beyond these requirements in general so is not a
determining factor. The primary determining factors being the repeatability of the AC source,
the repeatability of the EUT harmonics themselves, and the test time used for assessment.
Recommendations:

You must configure a test time suitable for the EUT which allows you to
achieve this level of repeatability. See table 1 of EN61000-3-12 or table
4 of EN61000-3-2 for some guidance regarding this.
The M2000 enforces no minimum assessment time other than 1 second.
For a stable EUT and a stable AC source, the standards provide no
minimum assessment time as long as it is “of sufficient duration to meet
the requirements for repeatability”. If the EUT and AC source can meet
this requirement with a 1 second assessment time, then such a time
may be used. However you must ensure that the 1.5 second filtering

M2000 Series Power Analyzers Operation Manual

M2000 SERIES OPERATION MANUAL
SECTION 8: APPLICATION SPECIFIC MEASUREMENTS

required by the standards has fully settled prior to starting an
assessment so the EUT must have been powered and stable for at least
10 seconds prior to starting the assessment, the M2000 does not
enforce this.
As stated in note 3 of figures A.1 and A.2 of EN61000-3-2, you may need
to use an AC source which significantly exceeds their stated
requirements in order to meet the repeatability requirement with some
EUTs. Although these notes suggest an increased requirement for
supply voltage stability, experience has shown that this also extends to
waveform shape repeatability.
With some EUTs you may need to decide whether the repeatability
requirement is applicable to some or perhaps to all harmonics. There
are primarily two situations where this may be appropriateSome EN61000-3-2 class C devices with low power levels are unlikely to
enable you to meet this requirement for any reasonable assessment
time, primarily because there is no minimum current level stated for the
repeatability requirement as it is presently worded in EN61000-3-2.
If reporting an assessment of a EUT which is failing the assessment then
some harmonics measured may be very significantly higher than the
limit, resulting in an unnecessarily small percentage of the
measurement as the repeatability requirement as it is presently worded
in EN61000-3-2 (also in EN61000-3-12 but in practice this situation is far
less likely for that standard).
EUT Classifications and Limits Selection
For both EN61000-3-2 and -12 the M2000 does not decide which classification a EUT falls into
and which limits table to apply. It is your responsibility to select the correct classification and/or
limits table to apply when assessing a EUT following the guidelines of each standard and taking
into account the features of the specific EUT.
When an assessment is made the M2000 takes and records internally all measurements
required, and all supply voltage and measurement testing is performed, in order to make an
assessment result available for any classification in EN61000-3-2 or for any limits table within
EN61000-3-12. This means that you can freely make an assessment, and then check the results
of that assessment afterwards to any of the classifications (but not changing between
standards). This also extends to the entry of reference levels for current, watts, and PF, which
may be required for some classifications, and the nominal Unom and Fnom entries, and the Rsce
entry; all of these may be changed freely after an assessment without requiring that a new
assessment be performed. This process is called “reassess” in the M2000. Basically it is
reassessment of measurement results already obtained from a prior assessment.
Recommendation:

When there is doubt regarding which classification or limits table to use
it is recommended that an assessment be performed to the desired
standard, initially to any classification, and that you subsequently
generate separate reports for each possible classification which you
decide upon. With the M2000 there is no need to repeat the entire
assessment process to accommodate this.

M2000 SERIES OPERATION MANUAL
SECTION 8: APPLICATION SPECIFIC MEASUREMENTS

You might consider making it your general practice to generate a final
assessment report, which contains the assessment of the EUT to all
classifications (or just to those which the EUT passes). This gives the
benefit of removing any doubt regarding whether the correct
classification was chosen for a EUT and may help should later versions
of EN61000-3-2 result in a change of classification of the EUT (as stated
in clause 5 of EN61000-3-2 this may occur in the future). By preassessing a EUT against each classification, you are already prepared for
such future changes.
EN61000-3-2 Classes & Tables Selection
The M2000 performs assessments denoted using the same classifications of EUT for classes A, B
and D as defined within EN61000-3-2. However EN61000-3-2 sub-classifies EUTs within its’ Class
C classification into four sub-classes, within the M2000 these are denoted as follows:





Class C(tbl2): the sub-class defined by the first paragraph of clause 7.3a) of this
standard.
Class C(tbl1): the sub-class defined by the second paragraph of clause 7.3a) of this
standard.
Class C(tbl3): the sub-class defined by the first set of requirements in clause 7.3b) of this
standard.
Class C(spcl): the sub-class defined by the second set of requirements in clause 7.3b) of
this standard.

By accommodating this expanded definition of Class C along with classes A, B and D, the table
within EN61000-3-2 defining the limits to be used for a EUT is thus explicitly defined and
selected by the M2000.
Recommendations:

The M2000 provides you with assistance in choosing the classification of
a EUT by giving the range of Watts measurements encountered during
the assessment; this along with other details available to you regarding
the EUT can then be used to allow you to select the classification to use.
According to EN61000-3-2, Class C(spcl) only applies to a EUT having a
specific current waveform which has a specific shape and has a specific
phase relationship to the voltage waveform (see figure 2 and clause
7.3b in EN61000-3-2). The M2000 does not check that the current
waveform meets this requirement and so this is your responsibility, it is
recommended that you capture the current waveform in some fashion
and check its shape and phase relationship and report those findings in
your final assessment report to support selecting class C(spcl). In
general, selection of class C(spcl) is not recommended and selection of
class C(tbl3) is recommended for such a EUT if possible.

EN61000-3-12 Table Selection
The M2000 performs assessments according to EN61000-3-12 using the tables 2, 3, 4 and 5 as
defined in that standard. It is your responsibility to choose the table to apply.
Notes: The M2000 provides you with assistance in choosing the classification of a EUT by giving

SECTION 8: APPLICATION SPECIFIC MEASUREMENTS

balanced load requires knowledge of whether the EUT was designed to have identical
phase loading, and if measurements are used then the word “identical” is probably too
narrow as no two measurements are ever “identical”.
The M2000also provides you with assistance in choosing tables 4 and 5 as these rely on
the EUT meeting certain conditions during assessment, entitled ‘a’, ‘b’, ‘c’, ‘d’, ‘e’ and ‘f’
in EN61000-3-12 clause 5.2, by reporting whether conditions ‘a’, ‘c’, ‘d’ and/or ‘f’ are
met. The M2000 cannot assist with whether conditions ‘b’ or ‘e’ are met (which are
actually both the same condition) as these depend on knowledge, which cannot be
obtained from measurements but are dependent on “the design of the piece of
equipment”.
The M2000also provides you with assistance in choosing which table to use for a
“hybrid” EUT by detecting if circumstance ‘a’ applies as defined in EN610000-3-12 clause
5.2. The M2000 cannot assist with circumstance ‘b’ for “hybrid” equipment as that is
dependent on “the construction of hybrid equipment”.
EN61000-3-12 RSE Value Selection
Assessment of a EUT to EN61000-3-12 requires a reference value entitled “Rsce” in EN61000-312. For all table selections, the selection of a Rsce value is critical to the pass/fail result of the
assessment and EN61000-3-12 contains the methods for you to use to derive its value and also
to ensure that the test wiring, current measurement resistance, and supply source resistance
are applicable for a given Rsce value.
Generally, a Rsce value of 33 may be applied (which is then generally acceptable for the EUT to
be used on all supplies), but often a EUT will not meet this requirement so a higher Rsce must be
selected by you which allows the EUT to meet the requirements but restricts the final use of the
EUT only to certain supplies.
The M2000 assists with this by allowing you to eithera) Configure a zero value for Rsce, in that case the M2000 automatically provides the
lowest value for Rsce for which the assessment results in a passing status for all supply
phases (if possible)
b) Change the configured Rsce value manually and reassess the measurements without
actually repeating the assessment itself.
Reassessing the previous assessment measurements in this manner may not be definitive as
a changed Rsce value may affect the requirements for supply source and the wiring used to
perform the assessment, so it may be necessary to actually repeat the entire assessment to
resolve a final Rsce value which is acceptable if the initial assessment was run with wiring
etc. assuming a lower Rsce value.
Range of Measurements for Compliance
It is often accepted without question that an EN61000-4-7 Class 1 compliant measurement
device such as the M2000 meets the measurement requirements of EN61000-3-2 and -12. This
is actually not the case in practice; the repeatability and reproducibility requirements contained
in EN61000-3-2 and -12 far exceed the accuracy requirements for a Class 1 device defined by
EN61000-4-7, and the Class 1 accuracy requirement in EN16000-4-7 does not guarantee that the
measurement equipment even has sufficient accuracy to assess a EUT to within the limits stated
in EN61000-3-2 or EN61000-3-2 -12.

SECTION 8: APPLICATION SPECIFIC MEASUREMENTS

The range of measurements specified below for the M2000 include the requirements for Class 1
of EN61000-4-7, the repeatability and reproducibility requirements of EN61000-3-2, and the
repeatability requirements of EN61000-3-12, all with a minimum of a 4:1 margin which is the
industry norm for measurement uncertainty. These are valid throughout the operating
environment range specified in section 4.15 of this manual when the M2000 is using its internal
current shunts – AD Card Type.
If using external current shunts – AX Card Type – refer to this section for further details.
Depending on the specifications of the external current device used, the range of currents,
power and power factor specified may be different when using external current devices.
When configured for EN61000-3-2 or -12 measurements, the M2000 is guaranteed to exceed
the requirements of the above listed standards within the following ranges of measurements
(this specification replaces all other relevant accuracy specifications contained in section 4 of
this manual for assessment results purposes only:









Frequency: Any frequency in the range 45-54Hz or 56-65Hz (assessment using
frequencies in the range 54-56Hz is possible but not recommended).
Voltage: Any phase voltage in the following range for each channel type (the
current option does not affect the ranges allowed:
 A channel type: 75-700Vrms.
Voltage Crest Factor: Solely limited by a maximum peak voltage of 1750Vpk.
Current and Current Crest Factor: Any current in the following range for each
current option (the channel type does not affect the ranges allowed) AD current option (HI range selection): 2.5mA-20Arms. Crest factor limited
to the lower of 100 or a maximum peak current of 150Apk.
 AD current option (AUTO range selection): 0.7mA-20Arms. Crest factor
limited to the lower of 100 or a maximum peak current of 150Apk.
 AD current option (LO range selection): 0.7mA-0.265Arms. Crest factor
limited to the lower of 100 or a maximum peak current of 1Apk.
 Note that EN61000-3-2 disregards all harmonics <5mArms in applying
assessment limits (see clause 6.2.3.4), so in practice it is reasonable to
assume that there is no requirement to assess EUTs with an RMS load
current <5mA as in that case all the harmonic assessment results would be
disregarded.
Total Power Factor: Any total power factor in the range 0.0001-1.0.
Fundamental Power Factor: Any fundamental power factor in the range 0.01-1.0
(for EN61000-3-2 classes C(tbl3) and D only, there is no fundamental power factor
range limitation for the other classes or for EN61000-3-12).
Power: Only limited by the voltage, current and power factor limitations stated
above.

External Current Measurements
The use of external current devices with a M2000 for any EN61000-3-2 compliance testing is not
needed and should not be used (unless the only available input channels are AX Type).
If necessary for EN61000-3-2, and as is often needed for EN61000-3-12 to accommodate its
current requirements, the use of external shunts in combination with theAX Type card in the
M2000 is recommended.

SECTION 8: APPLICATION SPECIFIC MEASUREMENTS

The requirements for external shunts, when needed for compliance with EN61000-3-2, -12 and
EN61000-4-7 standards, are as follows:










The resistance of the shunt must be such that the RMS voltage across the shunt is
<0.15Vrms at the maximum expected current draw of the EUT. This is a requirement of
EN61000-4-7 clause 5.1, however that requirement may be considered to be overridden
by both EN61000-3-2 and -12 as discussed in section 8.6.1.
The power handling capability of the shunt and its ability to dissipate heat in your use of
it must be such that there is less than 1% difference between its value at low currents
and that at the maximum expected EUT current.
The inductance of the shunt must be <10nH per mΩ resistance of the shunt. Note that
resistors which are claimed to be “non-inductive” always have some inductance so you
should consult the shunt resistor data sheet for a maximum inductance value; if none is
available then the shunt should not be used for this purpose. “Classical” DC shunts
generally do not meet this requirement, the use of “folded” or coaxial shunts is
recommended. You should also consider that since shunt inductance will always
increase the measurement results for high order harmonics, so if the EUT is passing the
requirements with the shunt being used then it would also pass (possibly with a wider
margin) with a “perfect” shunt.
The routing of the voltage sense wiring from the shunt to the power analyzer should be
such that it alters the apparent impedance of the shunt at 2kHz by less than 1%. This
generally means that the voltage sense wiring must be a closely twisted pair (not a
coaxial cable) of thin gage wires (26awg or thinner is recommended) and that it is
routed at right-angles to the current wiring for a distance of at least 1 foot from the
shunt and its current carrying wiring. The routing of the wiring is very dependent on
many factors. Some experimentation should be expected. Generally you can detect if
the wiring is a problem by simply changing it and noting any changes to the very high
order harmonics measurements, but this assumes that the load has sufficient such
harmonic content and that it is not also affected by the changes to the wiring routing.
You should note that this effect can either raise or lower high order harmonic
measurements, so can cause false passing or failing indications on a EUT.
You should consider the operating environment of the shunt. Low resistance shunts
typically have a high temperature coefficient of resistance, which will limit their ability
to be used with accuracy in a poorly controlled environment.
The shunt must be mounted and protected such as to maintain a safe environment. The
shunt is operating at an unsafe voltage so you must ensure that there is sufficient
mechanical shielding to ensure that objects or persons such as defined by EN61010-1
cannot touch any live voltage part of the shunt.

External Inductive Type Current Transducers
External inductive type current transducers such as coil or hall-effect types are generally not
recommended as few meet the requirements, although some do. The important features of
such a device are:


Accuracy
An overall accuracy of 1% (after calibration of the input:output ratio) is
required. You should also consider the reliance of the device on the position of the
current carrying wire within its aperture. Often this is of a substantial effect at these
accuracy levels.

SECTION 8: APPLICATION SPECIFIC MEASUREMENTS



Distortion
This is often the dominant factor in deciding on a device. EN61000-4-7
requires that harmonics measurements be made to within 0.15% of the fundamental at
each harmonic up to the 40th. Thus, it is recommended that the device have at least
twice this level of performance, as typically there are other effects, which are not
apparent when initially choosing such a device. Note, however, that the limits allowed
for harmonics in EN61000-3-12 are much larger than this so you should also consider
whether using lower performance transducers than this might be applicable.



Phase shift and frequency response
If the device has a poor phase shift specification
at 50/60Hz then it usually has a poor frequency response at 2kHz. The difference
between the input:output ratio at 2kHz to that at 50/60Hz should be <1%.
Compliance Tests Performed by the M2000 during assessment

The following tests are performed by the M2000 to ensure that EUT assessment is performed in
a manner compliant with the standards.
Testing the AC Source Voltage for Compliance
With the M2000, any AC power source having suitable power sourcing capabilities may be used.
However, it should be noted that the local mains supply is often not suitable, particularly for
EN61000-3-2 assessments. We recommend either Pacific Power Source, AMX Series, ASX Series
or AFX Series for this application or Adaptive Power Systems CPS100 Series.
In accordance with the requirements of EN61000-3-2 and -12 the supply voltage is continuously
checked by the power analyzer throughout the assessment of the EUT as follows. Note that
although some tests are not required for some EUT classifications, the power analyzer always
performs all of the tests. The EUT classification only affects whether the results of these tests
are visible to you.
Voltage
Each voltage is checked to ensure it remains continuously within a ±2%
range of the user specified nominal voltage (Unom) as specified by EN61000-3-2 clause A.2a and
-12 clause 7.2b.
Frequency
The supply frequency is checked to ensure it remains continuously within a
±0.5% range of the user specified nominal frequency (Fnom) as specified by EN61000-3-2 clause
A.2a and -12 clause 7.2b.
Frequency Lock
Short-term variations in the supply frequency are continuously checked to
ensure they remain within the ±0.03% limit within every 200ms measurement period as
specified by EN61000-4-7 clause 4.4.1 so is applicable to both EN61000-3-2 and -12
assessments.
 In most countries the local mains supply does not meet this requirement. In addition,
some AC sources may have cycle-to-cycle jitter in excess of this requirement.
Voltage Harmonics
Each voltage is checked to ensure it remains continuously within the
specifications of EN61000-3-2 clause A.2c. For EN61000-3-12 it is your responsibility to check
the voltage harmonics of each supply phase voltage when the supply is unloaded per clause
7.2d.
 For EN61000-3-12 this can be performed using the M2000 HARMONICS screen but it is
not part of the assessment process.
Voltage Crest Factor Each voltage is checked to ensure its crest factor remains continuously
within a modification of the range specified by EN61000-3-2 clause A.2d, see below for a

SECTION 8: APPLICATION SPECIFIC MEASUREMENTS

description of the modification to EN61000-3-2 requirements used by the M2000 in this regard.
EN61000-3-12 contains no such requirement and crest factor is not checked when assessing a
EUT to that standard.
 The crest factor of a pure, noiseless, sinewave is 1.414214 (= √2 to 7 significant figures)
and if the EN61000-3-2 stated allowable range of 1.40 to 1.42 is taken strictly (assuming
that all unstated digits are zeroes) then this stated range only allows 0.4% for the total
noise (always increases CF) + amplitude modulation (always increases CF) + any
distortion content which results in an increase in the crest factor, this may be overly
restrictive in practice. In the M2000 it is assumed that the intention of the standard is to
define a ±0.01 range centered on the nominal value for a pure sinewave (instead of the
1.41 value as stated) so the actual allowed range for supply voltage crest factor as
checked by the M2000 is from 1.404214 to 1.424214 (to 7 significant figures). It should
be noted that EN61000-4-7 clause 5.4.2.2d, although overridden in this regard by
EN61000-3-2, states a required range of 1.404 to 1.424.
 There is no definition of any bandwidth required for this measurement in either of these
standards, for example a 100GHz measurement bandwidth would certainly not result in
a suitable application of this limit. So it is assumed that a “reasonable” limit should be
used and the M2000 uses a 20kHz bandwidth limit for this measurement.
Phase of Voltage Peaks
Each voltage is continuously checked to ensure the phase position
of both positive and negative peaks are ±90°±3° as specified by EN61000-3-2 clause A.2d.
EN61000-3-12 contains no similar requirement and the peak phase position is not checked when
assessing a EUT to that standard.
 There is no definition of any bandwidth required for this measurement. For example, a
100GHz measurement bandwidth which could detect a noise pulse as short as 5ns
would certainly not result in a suitable application of this limit as the 3° range only
allows for a small amount of voltage noise. Particularly since every supply cycle within
the assessment period must meet this limit so even a very low probability noise event
will cause a failure of this requirement. So it is assumed that a “reasonable” bandwidth
limit should be used and the M2000 uses a 5kHz bandwidth limit for this measurement.
It should be noted that almost any such bandwidth restriction results in a delay which
varies with the frequency content and exact shape of the noise pulse, as is the case for
the M2000. This delay may result in the 3° range requirement having limited meaning in
practice.
Inter-phase Voltage Phasing The phase difference between every phase pair of a multi-phase
supply is required to be within ± 1.5° of 120° throughout the assessment period according to the
requirements of both EN61000-3-2 clause A.2b and -12 clause 7.2c. The M2000 continuously
checks this throughout the assessment if WIRING is configured for 3ø3w(3ch) or 3ø4w.
Recommendations:

The M2000 neither stops the assessment, nor prevents an overall
assessment pass/fail result of the EUT harmonics emissions if any of
these supply voltage tests fail. A separate indication is used denoting
which (if any) of these tests fail. Should any of these failures be
detected (particularly Voltage Crest Factor and Phase of Voltage Peaks)
then you are recommended to reach a decision whether to:
 Ignore the failure. This is a possibility if the EUT results indicate that
it meets the harmonics requirements with a high margin,
particularly since in practice the presence of such supply failures





would normally result in higher harmonic emissions results (in
particular, a high voltage crest factor, an unlocked frequency, or a
peak phase position error caused by noise rather than distortion). If
such a decision is reached, then it is recommended that you record
this in your test report along with a rationale for ignoring the
failure.
Repeat the assessment. In some cases these failures may be
transitory in nature; there may be a reasonable possibility that
simply repeating the test would not have the same supply voltage
failure. If such a decision is reached and it results in a successful
assessment, then it is recommended that you record this in your
test report along with a rationale for repeating the test however
there is no requirement to do so.
Independently assess whether the supply voltage failure was
significant or not. If such a decision is reached, then it is
recommended that you record this in your test report along with a
rationale and the results of the independent test.

Testing the M2000 Measurements for Compliance
In accordance with the requirements of EN61000-4-7 clauses 5.1 and 5.2 the measurements
made by the power analyzer are continuously checked throughout the assessment of the EUT as
follows:
Current Overload
Each phase current is checked for both peak (i.e. possibly transitory) and
RMS (i.e. probably significant) overloads during the entire assessment period. Peak and RMS
overloads are separately indicated.
Voltage Overload
Each phase voltage is checked for both peak (i.e. possibly transitory) and
RMS (i.e. probably significant) overloads during the entire assessment period. Peak and RMS
overloads are separately indicated.
Note: If an overload is detected, this is indicated as part of the assessment but does not affect
the indicated assessed pass/fail result of the EUT. If an overload is indicated then you
should decide whether or not to accept the assessment.
Recommendation:

8.6.2

Generally, if an overload indication is shown, the final pass/fail
assessment of the EUT should be disregarded and the assessment
repeated with the M2000 current range reconfigured such that no
overload will occur. If a voltage overload is shown, then something is
seriously wrong with the supply voltage and it should be investigated.

Configuring the M200 for EN61000-3-2 or EN61000-3-12
Measurements

This is achieved by using the MEAS CONFIG screen as follows:
1. Access the MEAS CONFIG screen by pressing the MEAS CONFIG button on the right side
of the power analyzer screen.
2. Press the MEAS MODE button and select the EN61000-3-2 or EN61000-3-12 choices as
applicable.
3. Configure the channels you wish to use as needed (see section 12.4.2.1).

4. None of the MEASURE area buttons are usable, they indicate the configuration for
measurements suitable for compliance testing and they are not changeable.
5. In the DATA area:
a. Select either the AC ONLY or AC+DC COUPLING selections by pressing the COUPLING
button and selecting the choice desired. Note that EN61000-3-2 and -12 have no
restrictions on this setting. However, EN61000-4-7 recommends that measurements
be AC ONLY although it does allow AC+DC measurements.
b. The RESPONSE setting cannot be altered as it is set by EN61000-4-7 to a single order
1.5 second response filter.
c. The DIGITS setting allows you to select how many digits of resolution will be
displayed for numerical results on most of the results screens. A selection of 5 is
recommended.
d. The ADJUST setting may be set as described in section 12.4.2.3.4. As previously
discussed for EN61000-3-2 and -12 measurements, generally the LOAD(V@LOAD)
setting is used with the V terminals connected to the voltages at the EUT. However,
any of the other settings may be used as long as they do not differ from the V
terminal wiring point and the SRCE(V@LOAD) and SRCE(V@SRCE) settings are not
relevant as those configure the power analyzer to make power measurements of
the source, not of the EUT.
6. If more than one channel is selected, then a COMBINE area is shown which contains the
WIRING button. This allows you select the wiring for the EUT and supply source. This
setting is described in section 6.8.2.1. However note that for a 3ø3w EUT the 3ø3w(3ch)
selection and wiring method should be used.
Selecting any other screen than the MEAS CONFIG screen will save this configuration, resulting
in measurements to the requirements of EN61000-4-7 (and so to the selected EN61000-3
standard) being available almost immediately.

Using Other Results Screens

Most of the other results screens available in the M2000 are also available, and are unchanged,
when configured for EN61000-3-2 or -12 measurements. Whether actually performing an
assessment or not, they have no effect on the assessment being performed. See section 6 for
full details regarding these screens. The HARMONICS screen has some changes however, as
detailed below.
Note: Holding measurements while performing an assessment also holds that assessment,
continuing it once released.
Using the HARMONICS Screen
The HARMONICS screen may be used in the normal fashion while configured for EN61000-3-2 or
-12 measurements. You can select to check harmonics against the limits requirements of
EN61000-3-2 or -12 (as configured). See section 6.11 for full details regarding using this screen.
Note: A comparison against limits performed in this manner is not sufficient for EN61000-3-2
or -12 compliance assessment, but it may be used as a check that the instantaneous
harmonics meet the basic requirements of those standards.
Any reference levels required to be used with the selected limits are those measured at
that instant, and Rsce (for EN61000-3-12) is assumed to be 33.
This screen can be used to check the harmonic content of the supply source when
unloaded, as required by EN61000-3-12. It can also be used to check the supply source
prior to EN61000-3-2 assessment if desired.
This screen can be used prior to EN61000-3-2 or -12 assessments to adjust the settings
on the EUT to determine the settings which result in the highest THC as recommended
by the standard.
8.6.4

Performing an Assessment of a EUT

An EUT assessment is performed by pressing the ASSESS EUT button which is only available
when the M2000 is configured for EN61000-3-2 or -12 measurements. The screen shown below
shows what will be seen if the ASSESS EUT button is pressed when no prior assessment has been
performed.

SECTION 8: APPLICATION SPECIFIC MEASUREMENTS

Selecting the Channel to View Results
The CHn (n can be 1, 2, 3 or 4) button allows you to select for which channel you are viewing the
results of the last performed, or ongoing, assessment. Note that all channels are assessed at the
same time; this selection only changes the channel for which the screen shows the results.
Selecting how Limits Reference(s) are Obtained
The second button from the left across the top of the screen (entitled MEAS REFS in the image
shown above) allows you to select the method used to obtain the reference level(s) needed for
setting harmonics limits. For EN61000-3-2 Class A and B this selection, although still present, is
not needed as those use absolute current limits which are not dependent on any reference
levels, all other classifications in EN61000-3-2 and all uses of EN61000-3-12 require this
however.
Changing this selection has an immediate effect on the displayed assessment results.
Note: The same reference levels are applied to the assessment of all phases of the EUT.
The reference levels only affect the limits applied, so do not affect the measurements
made during an assessment. This allows you to change this selection at any time.
The Power Factor reference is different to the other references, as required by
EN61000-3-2, in that a measured PF used as a reference is that obtained within the
same measurement period as that for which a measured Amps reference is obtained. So
the configured PF reference is only used if the configured Amps reference is used, and if
a measured Amps reference is used then the PF reference is set to the PF present in the
phase and at the time at which the Amps reference level was measured.
The available selections are:

When this is selected the reference levels as needed for the selected limits to be
assessed are taken from those configured (see later for configuring the reference levels) and can
be overridden by the maximum measured levels across all phases. As required by EN61000-3-2

and -12, if the maximum measured levels are within ±10% of the configured levels then the
configured levels are used by the power analyzer, otherwise the maximum measured levels are
used by the unit.
USER REFS
When this is selected, the configured reference levels are used by the unit,
regardless of the measured levels.
LAST REFS
When this is selected the reference levels present at the time that this was
selected are used for all future assessments until this setting is changed.
Recommendation: In most situations MEAS REFS should be used. Only when indicated by the
EN61000-3-2 or -12 standard should one of the other selections be used.
If you set zero for an Amps or Watts reference level and then assess the EUT
using USER REFS then MEAS REFS will be used for that reference level.
EN61000-3-2 Class D EUTs assessed according to Annex C.16.2 require that
the USER REFS selection be used and that the reference power be set by you
according to the equation stated in that clause.
Generally, when the LAST REFS type of action is required, you should
perform an initial assessment (usually with the EUT in its highest THC state)
with this set to MEAS REFS and the assessment results recorded in the
normal manner. Then you should select LAST REFS and perform additional
assessments (with the EUT in differing states) as needed. For example, when
performing the dimmed lamp tests EN61000-3-2 requires that the dimmed
levels be tested to the same limits (i.e. the using the same reference levels)
as used for the initial undimmed assessment.
Configuring and Starting an Assessment
The ASSESS button allows you to both configure and start an assessment of a EUT. When
pressed, a screen is initiated which allows to you to configure the assessment which will be
performed. An example of this screen is shown below.

The Unom level which you should set is that for the phase voltage, not the inter-phase
voltage.
With the exception of the Rsce value, the actual values entered do not change the
assessment pass/fail result, they merely set the levels at which a supply error is raised if
the measured voltage and/or frequency is beyond the allowed range from the entered
nominal value.
As previously described in section 8.6.1.3, setting a zero value for Rsce allows the
M2000 to automatically compute the Rsce needed for the EUT to have a PASS
assessment status on all supply phases (if possible). However, you may be required to
perform a second full assessment in this situation if the supply source and/or the EUT
wiring do not meet the new Rsce value requirements. Unless you are using an AC power
source and EUT wiring which meets the requirements for all possible Rsce values, then
some iteration may be required.
Configuring EUT Details
The EUT DETAILS section allows you to select the EUT classification and to set the reference
levels for the limits selected according to that EUT classification. See section 8.6.1.3 for details
regarding the EUT classification selections.
Notes: These settings may be changed, either during or after an assessment if desired by
pressing the REASSESS button as none of these affect the measurements made during
an assessment.
In most situations, a zero value for any reference level is recommended, although the
standards suggest that a manufacturer’s value should always be used and reported even
if it is not used in the final assessment result. Setting a reference level to zero forces the
use of the maximum measured value encountered during the assessment as the
reference level. See section 8.6.4.2 regarding how the reference levels which you
configure may be overridden. The usage of reference levels is defined in the EN61000-32 and -12 standards but to summarize:
 A Watts reference is only used when EN61000-3-2 table 3 is selected and affects
the limits for all harmonics.
 An Amps reference level is only used for all EN61000-3-12 tables, for EN610003-2 table 2, and for the special variant of EN61000-3-2 Class C, and affects the
limits for all harmonics. Note that the Amps reference level used by EN61000-312 is the Arms value and that for EN61000-3-2 is the fundamental current value.
Also note that the Amps reference level for EN61000-3-12 assessments affects
which harmonics are included in the THC and PWHC assessment measurements
as well as affecting the limits applied.

SECTION 8: APPLICATION SPECIFIC MEASUREMENTS



A Power Factor reference level is only used for EN61000-3-2 table 2 and only
affects the limit for the 3rd harmonic.

It is unclear from the EN61000-3-2 standard whether the Watts reference level should
be that for the entire EUT or that of a single phase. You should resolve this in those
situations where this may occur (those types of EUT, which require a Watts reference
level would rarely have multi-phase supplies). The power analyzer assumes that this is
the Watts reference for a single phase. If you decide that this is not the case, you should
enter the total Watts and select for USER REFS to prevent it being overridden, then
manually check the measured Watts results shown by the power analyzer to determine
if the reference needs to be altered and, if needed, use the REASSESS button to change
it. This does not require that the assessment measurement itself be repeated.
For EUTs assessed according to EN61000-3-2 Annex C.16.2 the Watts reference setting is
as described in the equation contained in that clause (which results in a single phase
Watts) and you should select for USER REFS to prevent it being overridden.
Configuring Assessment Timing
The ASSESSMENT TIMING section allows you to select the timing to be used for the assessment,
whether the assessment is to be performed in multiple intervals, and whether the assessment
will be affected by the EUT starting and/or stopping.
TEST TIME

This allows you to enter the time of an assessment or of an interval within
the assessment. You enter the time in days, hours, minutes and seconds and
this can be any value between 1 second and 99 days, 99 hours, 99 minutes
and 99 seconds. Note that this is the time actually assessing the EUT, any
time spent with the assessment paused is not counted towards this time.
In the data entry screen for TEST TIME there are four entries, one for each
unit of days, hours, minutes and seconds.
The screen always starts with the days data selected; you can jump to any of
the four entries directly by pressing the respective entry area.
You can enter a numeric between 0 and 99 into any of the four entries. The
actual time used is the total time created by combining all four entries with
their respective units.
When the ENT button is pressed the selected entry area automatically
changes to next entry to the right, unless the seconds entry is selected when
the action is same as pressing the RETURN button.

Recommendation: This setting directly affects the repeatability of the assessment
measurement results. You should carefully consider the value to use. See
section 18.1.3 for further details regarding this.
The M2000 enforces no minimum assessment time other than 1 second. For
some types of EUT Annex C of EN61000-3-2 does provide a minimum
assessment time and/or a minimum interval time when multiple intervals
are required, but for most EUT types the standards provide no minimum
assessment time as long as it is “of sufficient duration to meet the
requirements for repeatability”. If the EUT and supply source are stable
enough to meet this requirement with a 1 second assessment time, then

M2000 Series Power Analyzers Operation Manual

M2000 SERIES OPERATION MANUAL
SECTION 8: APPLICATION SPECIFIC MEASUREMENTS

such a time may be used, however you must ensure that the 1.5 second
filtering required by the standards has fully settled prior to starting an
assessment so the EUT must have been powered and stable for at least 10
seconds prior to starting the assessment, the M2000 does not enforce this
and in general the EUT will actually require longer than this to stabilize.
NUM INTERVALS

This allows you to select that an assessment is to be performed in two or
three intervals, each having an identical test time, with the assessment
being paused between intervals until you press the CONTINUE button, or to
be performed as a single interval.

Recommendation: This is generally not required and so should be set to 1, but in EN61000-3-2
Annex C there are situations where this activity is required and so should be
set to 2 or 3 accordingly.
AUTO START/STOP This allows you to select any activities regarding when the EUT is started or
stopped (i.e. draws significant power or draws little power). If set to other
than OFF then there are additional settings available which allow you to
enter the start/stop power detection level and the delay to use following a
transition between start and stop (see below for details). The available
selections areOFF

When this is selected the assessment always progresses and there is no
detection of whether the EUT is started or stopped.

DELAY ONLY

When this is selected whenever the EUT power changes from above the
detection level to below it (i.e. becomes stopped) or from below to above
(i.e. becomes started) then a delay is started during which the assessment is
automatically paused. This is the activity required by clause 6.2.3.3 of
EN61000-3-2 and clause 4.2.4 of EN61000-3-12 when a EUT is “brought into
operation” or “taken out of operation”.

AUTO PAUSE

When this is selected the assessment is continuously paused whenever the
EUT power is below the detection level.

AUTO STOP

When this is selected the assessment is only performed while the EUT
power is above the detection level and is automatically stopped when the
EUT drops below the detection or the configured test time has elapsed
(whichever occurs first). If the EUT power is below the detection level when
the assessment is started then it is paused until the EUT power goes above
the detection and then after the configured start delay has elapsed. This is
rarely used, but is useful if the EUT has only a relatively short period of
operation during assessment. Typically, the TEST TIME set would be longer
than the expected operation time of the EUT for this situation.

Note: Neither any delays nor pauses are considered part of the assessment time.
Recommendation: Most EUTs do not actually start or stop during an assessment so OFF is
generally recommended for this setting. For strict assessment to EN610003-2 and -12 then DELAY ONLY or possibly AUTO STOP settings should be
considered along with entering values for the start/stop detection power
level and the delay to use.

SECTION 8: APPLICATION SPECIFIC MEASUREMENTS

AUTO PAUSE is rarely used, but is included to allow full configuration
capability, particularly when mitigation is needed for an assessment failure.
AUTO STOP is rarely used, but is useful if the EUT has only a relatively short
period of operation during assessment. Typically, also the TEST TIME would
be set slightly longer than the expected operation time of the EUT in this
situation.
STOP POWER

This allows you to enter the start/stop detection power level and is only
available if AUTO START/STOP is not set to OFF. See above for how this
setting is used.

Recommendation: If needed this should be set to a suitable value to allow the M2000 to
reliably detect starting and stopping events in the EUT.
START DELAY

This allows you to set the number of seconds to delay after the EUT is
detected as starting or stopping before continuing the assessment level and
is only available if AUTO START/STOP is not set to OFF.

Recommendation: EN61000-3-2 clause 6.2.3.3only allows this to be set to 10 seconds, and
EN61000-3-12 clause 4.2.4 recommends 10 seconds but allows a longer
period. The M2000 allows any delay to be entered within the range 3
seconds to 1000 seconds.
Starting the Assessment
When the START button is pressed on this screen the assessment is started as you have
configured it and you are returned to the ASSESS EUT screen, otherwise if the CANCEL button is
pressed any entries you have made are discarded and you are returned to the ASSESS EUT
screen without an assessment being started.
Recommendation: You must ensure that the 1.5 second filtering required by the standards has
fully settled prior to starting an assessment so the EUT must have been
powered and have been stable for at least 10 seconds prior to starting the
assessment, the M2000 does not enforce this and in general the EUT will
require longer than this to stabilize.
For certain types of EUT the standards may have additional requirements
regarding a minimum stabilizing time period during which the supply source
and EUT are powered prior to starting an assessment. Particularly see Annex
C of EN61000-3-2 for further details.

8.6.5

Viewing the Results of an Assessment

Both during an assessment and after an assessment has been performed the results of that
assessment are displayed in the ASSESS EUT screen.
Notes: In some cases, as described in the following sub-sections, the data shown is specific to
the selected power analyzer channel to be viewed as selected by the leftmost button
across the top of the screen.
Throughout this screen all textual results information follow the same meaning for
textual coloring as follows:





If colored yellow then the data is as configured by you.
If colored white then the data is showing a measurement.
If colored green then the data indicates that there is no error or precautionary
condition.
If colored red then the data indicates an error or precautionary condition.

Although you may only view the results of the assessment, and may only start an assessment,
from this screen, you do not need to maintain viewing this screen during or after an assessment.
You can freely change between screens while an assessment is in progress and the results of a
completed assessment are retained if you change to viewing another screen.
The results of an assessment are only lost if you power cycle the power analyzer, you make a
significant change to the measurement configuration, or you start a new assessment with the
ASSESS button.
Textual Results – AC Power Source
The SUPPLY area shows the textual results of measurements made on the supply voltage during
the assessment. The data shown are (in order from top to bottom of the area)1. The pass/fail status of the AC Source checks (see section 8.6.1.5), note that this covers
all phases of the supply not just that selected to be viewed. If any failure is detected
then a numerical code is shown colored red which contains an indication of all detected
failures by means of adding the codes for each failure. Otherwise it shows OK colored
green. The codes are 1 The voltage was not within the allowed range from the configured Unom value
throughout the assessment.
 2 The frequency was not within the allowed range from the configured Fnom
value throughout the assessment.
 4 The frequency changed by more than 0.03% during any 200ms measurement
period.
 8 The supply voltage harmonics did not meet the requirements of EN61000-3-2
clause A.2c throughout the assessment. Note that when performing EN61000-3-12
assessments no checking of the supply voltage harmonics is performed.

16 The supply voltage crest factor was not within the allowed range per EN610003-2 clause A.2d throughout the assessment. Note that when performing EN61000-312 assessments or an EN61000-3-2 class A or B assessment is being displayed this
failure is not included.
32 The supply voltage peak phase position was not within the allowed range per
EN61000-3-2 clause A.2d throughout the assessment. Note that when performing
EN61000-3-12 assessments or an EN61000-3-2 class A or B assessment is being
displayed this failure is not included.
64 The inter-phase supply voltage phase was not within the allowed range per
EN61000-3-2 clause A.2b or EN61000-3-12 clause 7.2c throughout the assessment.

Recommendations: If codes 1 and/or 2 are found, either the assessment was not performed
with the AC power source set correctly, or the Unom and/or Fnom settings
in the M2000 were incorrectly set. In the later case, you only need to
change those settings with a REASSESS. In the former case, the AC power
source needs to be corrected and the entire assessment repeated.
If codes other than 1 or 2 are found then the supply source is not suitable
for performing the assessment.
2. The nominal voltage and frequency configured (i.e. Unom/Fnom). Note that these are
only displayed with 1V and 1Hz resolution, the full entered value resolution is actually
used.
3. The Rsce value configured or automatically determined by the power analyzer. The
same value of Rsce is used for all phases.
4. The actual measured voltage range of the supply phase selected. The minimummaximum voltages measured during the assessment.
5. The actual measured frequency range of the supply. The minimum-maximum
frequencies measured during the assessment.
Textual Results – Measurements
The MEASUREMENTS area shows the textual results of measurements in the channel selected to
be viewed during the assessment. The data shown are (in order from top to bottom of the area)1. If an overload was detected during the assessment (see section 8.6.1.5), this shows a
suitable message colored red describing that overload, otherwise it shows OK colored
green.
2. The actual measured power consumption of the EUT. The minimum-maximum power
measured during the assessment.
3. The actual measured current loading of the EUT. The minimum-maximum current (RMS)
measured during the assessment.
4. The actual measured power factor of the EUT. The minimum-maximum power factor
measured during the assessment.
5. The actual measured THC (Total Harmonic Current, in Amps) of the EUT. The minimummaximum THC measured during the assessment.

Textual Results – Limits
The LIMITS area shows the textual results of the limits selection and additional details regarding
limits selection obtained during the assessment. The data shown are (in order from top to
bottom of the area)1. The classification of the EUT (class for EN61000-3-2, table for EN61000-3-12).
2. The limits table called for by the selected classification (EN61000-3-2 only).
3. The reference levels for the selected limits table (if any).
4. Which “conditions” were detected (EN61000-3-12 only, does not include conditions b or
e). You should note that if condition a or d is detected, the detection of conditions c and
f may be unreliable as the 5th harmonic content may be extremely small (EN61000-4-7
requires that phase be ignored for harmonics less than 0.15% of the Amps reference
level so in that situation, you must consider whether to assume that these conditions
are present or not, depending on the construction of the EUT independently of the
indications of the M2000).
5. Which “circumstances” required for the table selection were detected (EN61000-3-12
only, does not include circumstance b).
Textual Results – Assessment
The ASSESSMENT area shows the status of an ongoing assessment, or the final assessment after
an assessment has been completed.
PASS (or PASSING during an assessment) is shown colored green if the result of checking the
limits is a pass, otherwise FAIL (or FAILING during an assessment) is shown colored red. The
assessment pass/fail shown is the total assessment, for all phases of the EUT.
If a failure is detected within the channel selected to be displayed, then below this is a listing of
the lowest numbered harmonics (up to three are listed) which are causing the failure. The
failures shown areAVG > LIMIT

This indicates that the indicated harmonic current in this channel has an average
measured value above the applicable limit and no exemption was found which
would allow this.

MAX > LIMIT

This indicates that the indicated harmonic current in this channel had one or
more measured values during the assessment which were above the applicable
limit and no exemption was found which would allow this.

THC > LIMIT

This indicates that the THC (Total Harmonic Current, as calculated from the
average harmonics over the entire assessment) for this channel was above the
allowable limit (EN61000-3-12 only).

PWHC > LIMIT This indicates that the PWHC (Partial Weighted Harmonic Current, as calculated
from the average harmonics over the entire assessment) for this channel was
above the allowable limit (EN61000-3-12 only).
Notes: If nothing is shown below a FAIL or FAILING status then the channel selected to be
displayed is not causing the failure

SECTION 8: APPLICATION SPECIFIC MEASUREMENTS

Although a PASSING/FAILING status is shown for the EUT during an assessment, this is
not the final status and may change later during the assessment. Similarly, the listed
failures shown for measured harmonics is not the final list and may change later during
the assessment.
The presence or absence of AVG > LIMIT and MAX > LIMIT indications do not mean that
the respective data is above or below the limit as contained in the table of the standard,
but its presence indicates that it is above the maximum amount allowed by the standard
for that specific data after including any allowable exemptions, see EN61000-3-2 clause
6.2.3.4 or EN61000-3-12 clause 4.2.5 for details regarding how the table limits are
applied as limits on measured harmonic data and any exemptions which may be
applied.
If an indicated harmonic fails for both AVG > LIMIT and MAX > LIMIT reasons then only
the AVG > LIMIT reason is shown in this list.
The THC and PWHC > LIMIT indications are as required by EN61000-3-12 and so do not
use the measurements of THC and PWHC but are instead calculated from the average
individual harmonics throughout the assessment (including disregarding harmonics in
the calculation of THC and PWHC if their average measured value is below the required
disregard level, see EN61000-3-12 clause 4.2.5).
Graphically Charted Results
Below the textual results is a chart which shows one of various measurements made by the
selected channel as they have been taken during the assessment.
You can select which of the following measurements is to be traced on this chart by using the UP
and DOWN arrow keys to the left of the chart.
Arms

RMS measurements of RMS current are charted and the Max, Avg and Min
numerical data shown are the maximum, average and minimum
measurements during the entire assessment.

Watts

Measurements of power are charted and the Max, Avg and Min numerical
data shown are the maximum, average and minimum measurements during
the entire assessment.

THC

Measurements of the total harmonic current (the combination of all
harmonics other than the fundamental) are charted. Note that the chart
does not show the data which is checked against a EN61000-3-12 limit as
that data is the THC of the average harmonics throughout the assessment,
however the Lim and Avg numerical data shown are the limit and that data
respectively and if performing EN61000-3-12 assessment then the Avg data is
colored red or green according to if it fails or passes respectively and the
limit value is plotted on the chart as a horizontal line at that current level for
reference purposes. Although this measurement is not used for EN61000-3-2
assessments it is still available as a useful reference.

POHC

Measurements of the partial odd harmonic current (the combination of all
odd harmonics 21st and above) are charted. Note that the chart does not
show the data which is used to define the POHC based exemption for
EN61000-3-2 harmonics as that data is the POHC of the average harmonics

throughout the assessment, however the Lim and Avg numerical data shown
are the limit and the data respectively which are used for that exemption and
if a EN61000-3-2 assessment is being performed the limit value is plotted on
the chart as a horizontal line at that current level for reference purposes.
Although this measurement is not used for EN61000-3-12 assessments it is
still available as a useful reference.
PWHC

Measurements of the partial weighted harmonic current (the combination of
all harmonics 14th and above, each weighted by their harmonic number) are
charted. Note that the chart does not show the data which is checked against
a EN61000-3-12 limit as that data is the PWHC of the average harmonics
throughout the assessment, however the Lim and Avg numerical data shown
are the limit and that data respectively and if performing EN61000-3-12
assessment then the Avg data is colored red or green according to if it fails or
passes respectively and the limit value is plotted on the chart as a horizontal
line at that current level for reference purposes. Although this measurement
is not used for EN61000-3-2 assessments it is still available as a useful
reference.

Ahn (n is 1 to 40) Measurements of the selected current harmonic are charted. The Lim, Max
and Avg numeric data shown are the limit (if any), the highest measured
value and the average measured value respectively. If the selected harmonic
has a limit set by the relevant standard then the Max and Avg data are
colored red or green according to if it fails or passes respectively and the
limit value is plotted on the chart as a horizontal line at that current level for
reference purposes.
Notes: The horizontal scale of this chart is always time, and is always scaled with the start of
the assessment at the left end and the configured end of the assessment at the right
end. If the assessment was stopped prior to the configured ending time then the chart
will not have data shown encompassing the entire horizontal span of the chart, only for
the time of the actual assessment.
The chart always has a zero value at the bottom of the vertical axis, and automatically
selects a suitable 1/2/5 based value for the upper limit for the vertical axis to ensure
that the trace (including that for the limit if applicable) is entirely shown.
This chart is provided to assist you in determining factors causing the failure or not of a
EUT to meet the requirements of the standards. The charted data shown is not actually
that used to determine the pass/fail status, as that encompasses data in more detail
than can be shown on such a chart.
Individual harmonics are allowed to be above the limit for moderate periods of time,
and by certain amounts, and may be completely disregarded, so it is valid to see
individual harmonics charted above the limit line but with an assessment status of PASS.
See the standards for details regarding how limits are applied (EN61000-3-2 clause
6.2.3.4 or EN61000-3-12 clause 4.2.5).

then this initiates the configuration screen similar to pressing the ASSESS button, and allows you

to change any of the SUPPLY or EUT DETAILS section entries but does not allow changes to the
TIMING section entries. When the RETURN button is pressed, the assessment results screen
returns with all assessment results now displayed using the newly entered configuration.
As previously mentioned, during an assessment the M2000 makes and records all
measurements as needed to perform an assessment of the EUT to any of the classifications and
with any reference level(s).
8.6.7

Continuing a Paused Assessment

If an assessment has been configured to be performed in more than 1 interval, then the M2000
will automatically pause an assessment when each of the intervals has been completed (except
for the last one when it will stop). In this case there is an additional button shown across the top
of the screen which is entitled CONTINUE which is only shown while the M2000 is paused in this
manner. While the CONTINUE button is shown, you should change the EUT conditions according
to the instructions in the standard and then press the CONTINUE button to start the next
interval which will be started immediately.
In this manner each interval has an identical assessment time and all measurements while
paused are disregarded as not being part of the assessment. The chart across the bottom of the
screen shows only the assessed measurements with no gaps between intervals, vertical lines are
shown in gold separating the intervals within the assessment for your reference.
Recommendation: You must ensure that the 1.5 second filtering required by the standards has
fully settled prior to continuing an assessment in this manner so the EUT
must have been operating under the changed conditions for at least 10
seconds prior to continuing the assessment, the M2000 does not enforce
this and this appears to have been overlooked in the standards.
8.6.8

Stopping an Assessment

An assessment in progress is denoted on the ASSESS EUT screen by the ASSESS button being
highlighted with a green color. While highlighted an assessment may be manually stopped by
pressing the ASSESS button. This does not abort an assessment but stops it just as if the test
time had elapsed.
Notes: This may be useful if you are not sure if the EUT has stable characteristics so have set a
lengthy test time, but subsequently discover during the assessment that the EUT is
stable so the assessment may be shortened and still meet the repeatability
requirements.
There is no loss of accuracy or lack of conformance to standards in the M2000 itself by
shortening a single interval assessment in this manner. However the chart shown on the
screen and the historical records contained in the report file are scaled to the
configured total assessment time so your ability to use those to obtain timing
information is reduced in resolution (this data is not required by a standard).
Generally, an assessment being performed in multiple intervals should not be stopped
in this manner unless it is wished to discard its results. Doing so will result in a
shortened interval which is not the same as preceding intervals and any remaining
intervals are not performed at all so in the case of multiple intervals the assessment will
not be to the requirements of the standards.

M2000 SERIES OPERATION MANUAL
SECTION 8: APPLICATION SPECIFIC MEASUREMENTS

There is a situation where it is valid to use this method of stopping an assessment with
multiple intervals however; if the assessment pauses with the CONTINUE button being
shown (so is at the end of an interval) and you realize that the number of intervals
configured is incorrect and sufficient intervals have actually been performed, then you
can stop the assessment at this time and meet the requirements of the standards.
8.6.9

Recording the Results on an Assessment

After an assessment has been performed then an additional button entitled REPORT is shown in
the rightmost position at the top of the screen. This is only shown if a valid USB Drive is inserted
into the front panel USB port and no other activity is in progress (such as data logging for
example) to that drive. Pressing this button allows you to enter a filename on that drive in which
to save all details regarding the assessment (the .CSV extension for the filename is automatically
appended to the filename). After entry of the filename, if a file already exists on the drive with
that name then you are also asked to select if it is OK to overwrite it. After entering the filename
(and selecting to overwrite as needed) the M2000 internally forms a file to write to the drive
containing all of the details and results of the assessment, including an historical record of all
harmonics and then writes this to the drive using the filename you supplied.
The file contains textual information using the “comma separated value” syntax commonly used
for spreadsheet information and can be opened by many different programs on a computer,
including text editors and word processing programs. Such a file is written as each line being a
“record”, and each column within that record being a “field”, with fields being separated from
each other by a comma character.
The file written by the M2000 in this manner has the following records:

Notes: A file generated in this manner can be up to 3Mbytes in size.
The recorded data covers all channels assessed independently of which channel is
selected as being viewed on the screen.
In the descriptive records, each phase of the supply is denoted as PhA through PhD, in
order of increasing channel number in the M2000.
Although manufacturer will attempt to preserve this layout of the records and fields
within the file, it may change if needed in future upgrades.
All times, limits and measurement results are generated in floating point format with 6
significant digits with an exponent value that is always divisible by 3 and have the native
units of the data being represented (e.g. times are in seconds, voltages are in Volts,
currents are in Amps, powers are in Watts). Note that no percentages are generated.
Saving this data as a file may be repeated as many times as you wish and you may
REASSESS the assessment as many times as you wish. In this manner you can record the
results of assessments to several different classifications (with different file names)
without performing separate full assessments. You can also save an image of the screen
as described in section 9, “USB Drive Usage” on page 208 of this document.

Avionics Electrical Power Measurement Requirements

This section applies specifically to power measurement requirements imposed by the following
two avionics test standards:


RTCA DO-160E/F/G (Section 16 – Power Input)



Boeing 787B3-0147

Definitions of terms used in this section:


Requirement



Equipment



Supply

Used to describe the avionics industry standard defining the testing
being performed.
Used to describe the equipment being tested to one of these
requirements.
Used to describe the power supply (or supplies) being used to provide
the power to that equipment.

The M2000 may be used for testing equipment to other avionics requirements by using the
general methods described in this section, but this section is specifically tailored for testing
performed to the following requirements Notes: It is your responsibility to ensure that any testing you perform to a requirement fully
meets that requirement.
Requirement Airbus ABD0100.1.8.1 (A350) specifically requires spectrum analysis rather
than harmonic analysis. You should use the M2000 spectrum analysis as described in
section 6.17 instead of harmonic analysis for testing ‘harmonics’, ‘inter-harmonics’ and
‘sub-harmonics’ to that requirement.
This section describes using the M2000 during several tests defined by the
requirements. If this section does not list a specific test, this does not indicate that the
power analyzer is incapable of assisting you in the execution of that test. It only
indicates that it may be of limited use or that the M2000 has not been evaluated to that
requirement. For example, the SCOPE or HISTORY capabilities may be of use in many
test steps.
8.7.1

Connecting the Power Analyzer

For all tests carried out to these requirements, the power analyzer should be connected using
one of the methods described in section 5.6. Generally, either the 1-phase or 3-phase 4-wire
methods will be used for these applications, corresponding to the supply being used by the
equipment.
In some cases, you may be providing the equipment with more than one supply. The power
analyzer can be configured to use multiple VPAs, one per supply, with the channels of each VPA
connected accordingly. The power analyzer will then monitor each supply independently and it
is not required that each supply have the same frequency. This manual section was written
assuming only a single supply is being tested.
8.7.2

Configuring Avionics Power Measurements

The measurement configuration of the power analyzer varies slightly between requirements,
and depends on whether an AC or a DC supply is used by the equipment.

For certain tests, the configuration may need to be altered from that shown in this sub-section.
Where that is necessary, it is detailed in the specific sub-section for that test.
The sub-sections below indicate the settings for the MEAS CONFIG screen for 3-phase, 1-phase

used for the supply.
If testing multiple supplies, then configure the MEAS MODE to MULTI-VPA and configure each
VPA for each supply type.

For RANGE setting:
 For AD or AX channels it will be as shown above.
 The AUTO setting should be chosen as shown above; the text shown in each AD RANGE
or AX RANGE button may have a different range (LO) or (HI) indicated as that shows the
actual range selected for the current being passed at that time.
For FUND setting:
 This must be set to AVIONICS as shown above.
For BANDWIDTH setting:
 Except for the Airbus requirements, the AUTO-TRACK setting should be chosen as shown
above. The text shown in the button may have a different frequency indicated as this
depends on the actual measured frequency at the time of each test.
 For the Airbus requirements a 300kHz fixed frequency bandwidth limit setting should be
set by using the USER choice and setting 300 kHz as the limit.
For HARMONICS setting:
 For DO-160E/F/G and 787B3-0147, a setting of 40 should be chosen as shown above.
 For the Airbus requirements a setting of 500 should be chosen (the M2000 will
automatically limit the actual number of harmonics to ≤150kHz as required in the Airbus
requirements because of the 300kHz BANDWIDTH setting used).

Using the M2000 to Monitor the Supply

These requirements all require equipment tested to meet performance requirements while
being subjected to various levels, frequencies, and disturbances to the supply used to power it.
In all cases, you will use a programmable power source (AC) of supply (DC), possibly with some
other circuitry or instruments, to provide the required supply to the equipment.
The power analyzer can be used to monitor the supply to the equipment to ensure that most of
these tests are being carried out properly, rather than just relying on the power source
producing the desired voltage, frequency and waveform.
For these tests, the M2000 is not making a measurement of the equipment, but is confirming
the supply being used to power the equipment. Whether the tests pass immunity or not is not
dependent on measurements made by the M2000.
If you wish to record the measurements made for documentation purposes, it is recommended
to either:

page 208)
Confirming the Voltage and Frequency of the Supply

The power analyzer may be used to confirm that the supply voltage and frequency are as
required for many of the tests to be performed.
This is done by using the POWER DATA screen, which should be selected to display the results
for the entire VPA (i.e. the entire supply), showing the COUPLED data (so the AC+DC or the DC
data is shown as configured for this supply), and showing the full DETAILED information.
The primary data (shown in larger, yellow colored text) for voltage and current shows the
average of the phase voltages and currents from the supply (for a 1-phase AC source or DC
supply there is only a single phase).
The secondary data (shown in a smaller, white colored text) for voltage and current lists the
voltages and currents from each phase from the supply (for a 1-phase AC source or DC supply
there is only a single phase). Also included in the secondary data for voltage are the inter-phase
phase measurements.
The frequency shows the supply frequency (not shown for a DC supply).
Confirming the Voltage Modulation of the Supply
The power analyzer may be used to confirm that the supply voltage modulation depth is as
required for the tests to be performed.
Notes: The bandwidth of the measurement may have a severe impact on the results obtained.
The requirements do not generally state any specific bandwidth for such a
measurement, yet this is a measurement of peak values, which are very dependent on
the measurement bandwidth. You may wish to alter the MEAS CONFIG - BANDWIDTH
setting while performing these tests to a lower value (e.g. 4 kHz) to reduce the
bandwidth of the measurement.
The M2000 cannot confirm the frequency content of the modulation.
It is required that this value be measured over many measurement periods of the power
analyzer (so giving a result for low frequency modulation). This is achieved by using the POWER
DATA screen configured to show each channel, and INRUSH data.
To use this screen follow the procedure described below:
1. Select the POWER DATA screen as shown above.
2. Press the CLEAR button.
3. Wait for the desired period of time (for example 2 minutes for DO160E 16.5.1.2). The
time and date displayed on the M2000 screen may be of assistance in determining the
time elapsed.
4. Press the area showing MEASUREMENTS RUNNING (this is called the MEASUREMENT
INFO area in this manual). This holds all measurements enabling you to view and record
data without being concerned about the time taken to do so.

SECTION 8: APPLICATION SPECIFIC MEASUREMENTS

5. Record the indicated voltage Vpk and Vly data. The difference between these is the
difference between the highest peak and the lowest valley encountered during the
period between pressing the CLEAR button and recording the result.
6. Step 2 clears the data for all channels, so for a 3-phase supply you do not need to repeat
the entire procedure for each phase if all phases are being modulated. Just repeat step
5, changing the selected channel to record the measurements for each phase.
7. Do not forget to release the measurement hold after recording all phases.
Note: It may also be useful (but not required) to view the short-term modulation; this is
performed by using the POWER DATA screen as above but configured to show the
COUPLED data and showing DETAILED. In the secondary data (shown in a smaller, white
colored text) for voltage is a measurement result entitled Pk-Vly. This is the maximum
peak-to-valley difference measured and updated each measurement period. Because
the M2000 is configured for a 100ms measurement period, this value will fluctuate in
response to modulation at frequencies which are not a multiple of 10Hz.
Confirming the DC Voltage Content of the Supply
The M2000 may be used to confirm that the supply voltage DC content is as required for certain
tests to be performed.
This is performed by using the POWER DATA screen which should be selected to display the
results for each channel, showing the COUPLED data (so the AC+DC or the DC data is shown as
configured for this supply), and showing the full DETAILED information.
In the secondary data (shown in a smaller, white colored text) for voltage is a measurement
result entitled DC. This is the DC content of the supply voltage phase being viewed.
Confirming the Voltage Distortion of the Supply
The power analyzer may be used to confirm that the supply voltage distortion content is as
required for certain of the tests to be performed.
Note: As defined in DO160E/F/G, section 16.5.1.8.1.1, this is an impossible measurement to
perform as it requires that the distortion be measured over an infinite number of
harmonics. In this manual, it is assumed that the requirement intended that this
measurement be performed over the same number of harmonics as defined for the
current distortion tests in each requirement.
This is done by using the POWER DATA screen which should be selected to display the results for
each channel, showing the FUNDAMENTAL data, and showing the full DETAILED information.
In the secondary data (shown in a smaller, white colored text) for voltage is a measurement
result entitled THDf. This is the percentage distortion content referenced to the fundamental
component of the supply voltage phase being viewed.
Confirming the Voltage Ripple Content of the Supply
The power analyzer may be used to confirm that the supply voltage ripple content is as required
for certain tests to be performed.
Notes: The bandwidth of the measurement may have a severe impact on the results obtained.
The requirements do not generally state any specific bandwidth for such a
measurement, yet this is a measurement of peak values, which are very dependent on

the measurement bandwidth. You should alter the MEAS CONFIG - BANDWIDTH setting
while performing these tests to a value to provide a standardized bandwidth of the
measurement. A setting of 25kHz for BANDWIDTH is recommended for these tests.
The M2000 cannot confirm the frequency content of the modulation.
This is performed by using the POWER DATA screen, which should be selected to display the
results for each channel, showing the COUPLED data, and showing the full DETAILED
information.
In the secondary data (shown in a smaller, white colored text) for voltage are measurement
results entitled Pk, one with an up arrow and the other with a down arrow. These provide the
measurement of the highest and lowest extents of the ripple, the difference between these two
measurements is the peak-to-peak ripple.

Using the M2000 to Test Compliance to Loading Requirements

The M2000 can be used to monitor the supply to the equipment to ensure that most of these
tests are being carried out properly and also simultaneously make the desired load current
measurements.
If you wish to record the measurements made, then it is recommended to either:
 Save a graphical copy of the screen(s) to a USB Drive (see section 9)
 Export all measurement results to a USB Drive (see section 9)
 Export all harmonics results to a USB Drive (see section 9)
 Export all spectrum results to a USB Drive (see section 9)
 Export the cycle view results to a USB Drive (see section 9)
Testing Load Current Distortion
The M2000 may be used to confirm that the supply voltage and frequency are as required, and
the load current is within the distortion limits.
Note: In the reporting requirements of DO160E/F/G, it states that the load current harmonics
must be reported. It is also stated that the spectrum of the load current must be
reported. It is assumed that it is intended to be either, not both as written, as they allow
the use of either type of equipment and do not require both. If both are required, then
the spectrum may also be measured and recorded using the methods shown in section
6.17.
There are several reporting requirements for this test, each of which requires a specific screen
to view. These are described in the following paragraphs.
Voltage and Current Waveforms
The voltage and current waveforms can be viewed using the SCOPE – CYCLE VIEW screen
configured to show the desired voltages and currents (all three phases of voltage and
current can be displayed together if desired).
Voltage and Current Harmonics
The voltage and current harmonics can be viewed using the HARMONICS screen. There is no
need to view the harmonics to be able to record them, but it is recommended to do so to
check that the measurement is being made properly. This screen can be used to view all of
the voltage or current harmonics graphically for any phase of the supply with a variety of

formats, and also provides a scrollable numerical listing showing up to 8 harmonics at a
time.
Load Input Current
This is performed by using the POWER DATA screen, which should be selected to display the
results for entire VPA (i.e. the entire supply), showing the COUPLED data, and showing the
full DETAILED information.
The primary data (shown in larger, yellow colored text) for voltage and current shows the
average of the phase voltages and currents from the supply (for a 1-phase supply there is
only a single phase).
The secondary data (shown in a smaller, white colored text) for voltage and current lists the
voltages and currents from each phase from the supply (for a 1-phase supply there is only a
single phase).
The frequency shows the supply frequency.
Supply Voltage THD and Load Current THD
This is performed by using the POWER DATA screen, which should be selected to display the
results for each channel, showing the FUNDAMENTAL data, and showing the full DETAILED
information.
In the secondary data (shown in a smaller, white colored text) for voltage and for current is
a measurement result entitled THDf. This is the percentage distortion content referenced to
the fundamental component of the supply voltage and current for the phase being viewed.
Testing Load Phase Imbalance
The power analyzer may be used to confirm that the load phase imbalance is as required. This is
performed by using the POWER DATA screen, which should be selected to display the results for
entire VPA (i.e. the entire supply), showing the COUPLED data, and showing the full DETAILED
information.
The primary data (shown in larger, yellow colored text) for voltage and current shows the
average of the phase voltages and currents from the supply (for a 1-phase supply there is only a
single phase), the primary data for W, VA, VAR and PF show the total values for the entire
supply.
The secondary data (shown in a smaller, white colored text) lists the measurements for each
phase from the supply (for a 1-phase supply there is only a single phase).
The frequency shows the supply frequency.
The displayed VA is the “apparent power (volts-amps)” requirement. The displayed W is the
“real power (watts)” requirement. The displayed VAR is the “reactive power (vars)”
requirement. The values for each phase can be checked against the requirement.
Testing Load DC Current Content
The power analyzer may be used to confirm that the load DC current content is as required. This
is performed by using the POWER DATA screen, which should be selected to display the results
for each channel, showing the COUPLED data, and showing the full DETAILED information.

SECTION 8: APPLICATION SPECIFIC MEASUREMENTS

In the secondary data (shown in a smaller, white colored text) for current is a measurement
result entitled DC. This is the DC content of the load current for the phase viewed.
Testing Load Inrush Current Content
The power analyzer may be used to confirm that the load inrush current is as required. This is
performed using the Inrush Current Capability of the SCOPE VIEW screen as described in section
6.14.
The time base must be set to cover a long enough period to ensure the full requirements are
met -- 2 seconds for DO160F, so 0.5s/div with a 25% trigger position is recommended. You will
have to zoom in to the smaller time periods and check the load current accordingly.
Testing Load Current Modulation
The power analyzer may be used to confirm that the load current modulation is as required.
Note: The bandwidth of the measurement may have a severe impact on the results obtained.
You may want to alter the MEAS CONFIG - BANDWIDTH setting while performing these
tests to a lower value (e.g. 4kHz) to reduce the bandwidth of the measurement.
It is required that this value be measured over many measurement periods of the M2000 (so
giving a result for low frequency modulation) this is achieved by using the POWER DATA screen
configured to show each channel, and INRUSH data.
To use this screen follow the procedure described below:
1. Select the POWER DATA screen as shown above.
2. Press the CLEAR button.
3. Wait for the desired period of time (for example 1.5 seconds for DO160F 16.7.6).
4. Press the area showing MEASUREMENTS RUNNING (this is called the MEASUREMENT
INFO area in this manual). This holds all measurements enabling you to view and record
data without being concerned about the time taken to do so.
5. Record the indicated current Apk and Vly data. The difference between these is the
difference between the highest peak and the lowest valley encountered during the
period between pressing the CLEAR button and recording the result.
6. Step 2 clears the data for all channels, so for a 3-phase supply you do not need to repeat
the entire procedure for each phase if all phases are being modulated. Just repeat step
5, changing the selected channel to record the measurements for each phase.
7. Do not forget to release the measurement hold after recording all phases.
Testing Load Current Modulation
The power analyzer may be used to confirm that the load power factor is as required. This is
performed by using the POWER DATA screen, which should be selected to display the results for
entire VPA (i.e. the entire supply), showing the COUPLED data, and showing the full DETAILED
information.
For all power factor data, if followed by an upwards pointing arrow the power factor is leading,
otherwise it is lagging.
The primary data (shown in larger, yellow colored text) for PF shows the overall power factor
from the supply (for a 1-phase supply there is only a single phase).

Multiple M2000 Instrument Applications

Certain measurements and activities can be shared between two or more M2000 instruments.
This provides the following capabilities:


Up to 1000 M2000 units may be interconnected.



The SYNC measurement mode, which allows VPAs within a single unit to have
synchronous measurement starting and period (see section 12.4.1) is extended to
accomplish this among multiple units configured using this measurement mode.



All unit’s measurements can be held or released simultaneously from any unit.



All unit’s integrations can be started and/or stopped from any unit.



All unit’s historical data collection can be started or stopped simultaneously from any
unit.



All units share their IN, MID and OUT power totals and display the total of all units and
show the overall system efficiency data.



Any VPA in any unit can make its’ fundamental available to any other VPA(s) in any
other unit(s) by using one of the 3 available global fundamental frequencies.

8.8.1

Interconnecting Multiple M2000 Units

M2000 units perform these capabilities by communicating with each other via their LAN
interfaces. You do not need to be using the LAN interface for communicating with the units via a
computer - as that can be accomplished using a different interface if desired - or there can be no
interfacing to a computer.
Interconnections when not Interfacing to a PC
In this case the individual units should typically be configured to use the AUTO-IP LAN interface
mode. This allows the individual instruments to determine their own IP addresses and discover
each other automatically.
Notes: If only two units are to be interconnected then simply use a standard LAN cable (CAT5e
recommended) between the LAN ports of the two units without connecting them to a
network. A crossover cable is not required, but may be used if desired.
If more than two units are to be interconnected, then an Ethernet switch or hub must
be used. Connect each unit’s LAN port to ports on that switch or hub. In situations
where a great many units are to be interconnected then multiple switches or hubs may
be needed.
The individual units can be connected to each other via an existing LAN network if
desired. All such instruments must be visible to each other on that network. In this
scenario, it may be desirable to use DHCP or FIXED IP LAN modes instead of AUTO-IP.

SECTION 8: APPLICATION SPECIFIC MEASUREMENTS

Interconnections when also Interfacing to a PC
In this case, the units communicate with each other over the LAN network to which each unit is
connected using whatever LAN configuration is required for the network. All such instruments
must be visible to each other on that network.
Note: The units communicate with each other using UDP port 10734. This traffic must be able
to be communicated between all units through any intermediate routers. The M2000
uses IGMP to attempt to manage any routers, managed switches, or “snooping”
switches, to allow the transmission of such traffic.
Using Several Groups of M2000s with a Single Network
Each unit can be configured to operate its multi-unit capabilities within a defined group number.
This group number is configured by the user on the Multi-Unit Configuration Screen (see below)
and can be any numeric value between 0 and 255 inclusive. There is no particular significance to
the group number other than only units configured for the same group number provide the
multiple unit capabilities. Each group may have up to 1000 members, and there may be 256
such groups, so the maximum number of M2000s which can be connected to the same LAN
segment is 256,000.
8.8.2

Configuring Multi-Unit Capability

Each M2000 used within an interconnected multi-unit group needs to be configured for a group
number they are a member off, and which global fundamental data (if any) is being provided by
each VPA in the M2000. This achieved by using the MULTI-UNIT button from the Interface
configuration screen as follows:
1. Press the Interface information area on most screens to access the Interface
Configuration screen.
2. Press the MULTI-UNIT button at the top of this screen to access the Multi-Unit
Configuration screen (an example of this screen is shown below).
3. Either turn OFF multi-unit capabilities, or turn them ON and select the multi-unit group
number using the OFF/GROUP n button at the top of this screen.
4. For each configured VPA within this M2000 you can select for that VPA fundamental to
be provided globally to all M2000s within the multi-unit group by selecting that it be
provided to all units as the GFUND1, GFUND2 or GFUND3 data.
Note:
a. Only a single unit and a single VPA within that unit can provide data to any given
GFUND data.
b. Any number of VPAs in any number of M2000s may use each GFUND
measurement data (including a VPA within the same M2000, which is providing
the data).
c. A GFUND data cannot be circularly configured, e.g. if VPA1 within a M2000 is
configured to use GFUND1 as its fundamental then VPA1 within that M2000
cannot be configured to provide the VPA1 fundamental as GFUND1.
d. If a conflict is discovered in a GFUND data provided by this M2000 (i.e. another
M2000 is also configured to provide this data) then the button is colored RED.
5. You can display a list of the units discovered within the configured multi-unit group in
the OTHER MEMBERS area of the Multi-Unit Configuration screen (other than the
M2000 on which it is being displayed). Typically this can take a few seconds to respond

to other M2000s being taken into or out of service or their multi-unit configuration
being changed. If more than one other unit is detected, PREV and/or NEXT buttons are
provided to scroll between the discovered units. The information displayed for each
discovered unit includes:
a. The identity name (if any) for that unit.
b. The IP address of that unit.
c. If that unit is configured for SYNC mode measurements.
d. If that unit provides any IN, MID and/or OUT measurement data.
e. If that unit is configured to provide any GFUND measurement data.

8.8.3

Synchronizing Measurements within a Group

All M2000s configured within the same Multi-Unit group number, and are connected to each
other, and are configured for SYNC measurement mode (see 6.8.1) will start their
measurements at the same time and another measurement cannot be started until all such
measurements have been completed within all VPAs in all configured units in this manner. See
section 8.9 for further details regarding this.
Note: Only units configured to use the SYNC measurement mode are synchronized in this
manner.
Other than configuring the required units to use the SYNC measurement mode, no other
configuration is necessary to achieve this capability.
Recommendation: This capability should only be used when necessary. Measurements are
generally not continuous when operated in this manner. Typically, this is
only useful when units are measuring values which vary considerably over
time and even in such situations typically simply using a faster
measurement period and result response averaging is usually
recommended.

Starting, Stopping and Configuring Data Integration for a Group

Starting and/or stopping integration using the front panel or an interface on any M2000 within a
multi-unit group affects all units within that group simultaneously, No configuration is necessary

started is automatically used within all such units. See section 8.4 for details regarding
integration.

Starting, Stopping and Historical Data Collection for a Group

Starting and/or stopping historical data collection using the front panel or an interface on any
M2000 within a multi-unit group affects all units within that group simultaneously, no

Note: The times and dates shown on the screen for each unit within such a group are
determined within each specific M2000, so differences in the displayed data may be
seen. The actual starting date/time is the same for all such units.

IN, MID and OUT Total Power & Efficiency for a Group

All units within a multi-unit group automatically provide their IN, MID and OUT power data to all
other members of the group without needing configuration. The IN, MID, OUT and Efficiency
data available from any individual M2000 within the group always includes the data from all
members of the group.

SECTION 8: APPLICATION SPECIFIC MEASUREMENTS

8.9

Synchronizing Measurements between VPAs

The M2000 can be configured to synchronize the starting time of measurements in different
VPAs to accommodate measurements of power loss and efficiency when the power levels are
varying rapidly over time. This is always possible within a single M2000 and optionally also
between multiple M2000s using the Multi-Unit capabilities (see section 21).
This is achieved by selecting the SYNC measurement mode in the M2000 (for a single M2000) or
in each M2000 which it is desired to synchronize within a Multi-Unit group.
Notes: Not all units in a Multi-Unit Group need to be configured with the same measurement
mode, the same measurement period or to use the same fundamental frequency.
Selecting the SYNC measurement mode only has any benefit when it is desired to
accurately track power loss and/or efficiency during significant changes of power level.
In most applications the SYNC mode is not recommended.
Synchronizing VPAs in this manner causes all such VPAs except for the one with the
longest measurement period to have small gaps between their measurement periods
during which no measurement is being made. Typically, this has little consequence and
is not specific to the M2000 but applies to any synchronized measurement periods
having different lengths.
This is not the same as selecting for the measurement period of a VPA to be
synchronous to that of another VPA in the same M2000 by setting the PERIOD setting in
one VPA to another VPA in the same M2000 (see 6.8.2.2 for details regarding this) as
configuring in that manner requires that both VPAs have exactly the same measurement
period and forces them to use exactly the same fundamental frequency for
measurement synchronization. This is only available within a single M2000. When
configured for SYNC mode, even in different M2000s, you can configure any VPAs to use
the same fundamental frequency and so have the exactly the same measurement
period length by using the FUND configuration setting or they can each independently
derive their own fundamental frequencies as needed.
Within a single M2000, or within multiple M2000’s in the same Multi-Unit group, if configured in
SYNC measurement mode, all VPAs perform synchronization collectively as follows:
After completing every measurement period every such VPA checks if all other VPAs in
the collection are presently waiting after completing their measurement periods. If all
such VPAs have already completed their measurement periods then all VPAs are
commanded to start a new measurement period, otherwise this VPA waits to be
commanded by another VPA to start a further measurement period and informs all
other VPAs as such (using a multi-cast packet within a Multi-Unit group if synchronizing
multiple M2000’s).
In this manner each VPA may optionally be configured with a different measurement period (or
not), whether by setting a different PERIOD setting for each or because VPAs have different
signals to which they are synchronizing their measurement periods (i.e. each is measuring
signals having different and unrelated frequency content).
Within a single M2000 the starting times of such measurements are synchronized to within
10μs, and for VPAs in different M2000’s using the Multi-Unit capability this is extended slightly
by the LAN interface delay. The synchronizing information passed between multiple M2000’s is

M2000 SERIES OPERATION MANUAL
SECTION 8: APPLICATION SPECIFIC MEASUREMENTS

a single minimum length packet on the LAN interface which is multicast to all configured
M2000’s with the highest priority, so typically this incurs an additional delay of 6.4μs times (1 +
the number of intervening switches in the network topology).
The effect of such slight differences between the starting times of the measurements is typically
quite minor as described below:
 These differences only effect measurements of power loss and efficiency when signals
are changing; there is no error if the signals are not substantially changing and there is
no error in the measurements of power within each VPA itself under any circumstances.
 Since multiple M2000s use multi-casted communications for synchronization and almost
all switches forward multi-casted packets virtually simultaneously between ports, this
delay is not dependent on the number of M2000s in a Multi-Unit Group.
 The worst case delay (for a 100M LAN) between multiple M2000’s with a single
intervening switch is 152μs if both a) there is other traffic present on that network
portion at exactly the same time as one M2000 finishes a measurement period and b)
that traffic has the maximum packet length and c) is destined for one of the M2000s
being synchronized. Traffic between other network nodes has negligible affect for
typical switches as they employ different packet buffers and routing between nodes.
 Irrespective of the cause of these delay errors, they are not cumulative. I.e. the error
over 5 measurement periods is 1/5th of the error over one measurement period. In
many circumstances it is useful to use this to advantage by selecting a faster nominal
measurement period in every VPA and selecting for averaging using the same RESPONSE
setting in each VPA.
 If all such VPAs are configured for 100ms nominal measurement periods then the worstcase error in power loss or efficiency measurements is 0.001% of the intermeasurement change per μs of delay between VPAs (or 0.01% if configured for a period
of 10ms, or 0.00033% if configured for 300ms). Within the same M2000 this yields a
worst case error of 0.01% of the change, or typically 0.0164% of the change with
different M2000’s without intervening switches. As an example using 100ms
measurement periods, if a power level suddenly changes from 100W to 200W during a
single 100ms measurement period, then there is a possible error of up to 0.01% of
100W (i.e. 10mW) in power loss/efficiency in that one 100ms measurement period in
which the 100W power level change occurred but there is no error in the measured
power loss or efficiency in any measurement period either before or after the change.
 If such VPAs are measuring signals having different frequency content then the
differences in measurement periods caused by that different content is typically of more
significance than errors caused by synchronization delays. This is because the
measurement periods are not the same and so exact synchronization is not possible. It is
not possible to give a general typical figure for this effect, but the measurement period
for every VPA can be estimated by calculating the period of the nearest integer number
of fundamental cycles in the configured measurement period and then calculating the
difference between the shortest and longest such measurement period.
 For example, if one VPA is measuring mains at a frequency of 50Hz, and another is
measuring the output of an electronic lighting ballast at a frequency of 15.23456kHz and
both are set for a measurement period of 100ms, then the first measurement period
will be that of 5 cycles (i.e. 100ms) while the second will be that of 1523 cycles (i.e.
99.97ms) so this incurs an additional 30μs of difference (i.e. an error of 0.03% of change
between measurement periods). It should be noted that this error is typically far less



than that caused by the common industry practice of erroneously forcing all
measurement periods to be exactly the same as that causes all but one of the signals to
be incorrectly measured whether the signal levels are changing or not. The M2000 does
not force all measurement periods to be identical.
Range changes typically have the most dominant effect as they very significantly
elongate a measurement period (possibly by 10:1 or more) only in the affected
channel(s). There is a common industry practice of requiring a range change for changes
in voltage and/or current levels of 3:1 or less which is very dominant in these situations
as such a change forces loss of synchronization and the inaccuracy caused by forcing the
highest suitable range is generally much larger than the inter-measurement delay errors
(e.g. if inaccuracy is specified as 0.05%range then that is an error of up to 0.45% caused
by selecting a fixed range which is only one range higher than needed for that particular
level). In the M2000 this is of far less consequence as a range change can only occur in D
type current option channels, only takes 1ms, is only a single range change, only occurs
when a very large change in current level occurs (1000:1), and has a negligible effect on
accuracy.

Recommendation: As discussed above there is considerable multi-cast LAN traffic when
measurement periods are being synchronized between multiple M2000’s in
this manner. This can have a slight effect on other network traffic if it is
allowed to traverse the entire network. Multi-cast traffic is not passed
through a correctly configured router and also IGMP “snooping” switches
can be used which limit multi-cast traffic to only those nodes which request
it (i.e. only M2000’s). When multiple M2000’s are synchronized in this
manner it is recommended to limit any effects on the remainder of the
network by using such devices as needed.

Drive Compatibility

A wide variety of USB thumb drives are compatible with the M2000 as long as they meet the
following requirements:







9.3

The drive must be directly connected to the Front Panel USB Port. DO NOT use a
USB hub or extension cable in-between.
Meet USB Mass Storage Class specification and be a single physical drive. Multidrive convertors cannot be used.
Meet USB2.0 or higher using full-speed. Note that if marked as High Speed, it also
meets the Full Speed requirement.
Require less than 500mA of power from the USB port. Some USB3.0 drives do not
meet this requirement.
The drive must use 512 bytes per sector. This is a requirement of the USB Mass
Storage Class but there are a few drives that do not use this sector size.
The drive may be partitioned, but only the first FAT32 partition - as defined by
Microsoft - will be used and it must be <4Tbyte in size. In most cases you can
reformat the drive to meet this requirement. Generally, drives or partitions <1Gbyte
cannot be formatted with FAT32 however.

Checking Drive Compatibility

If a drive is compatible with a computer, that does not necessarily mean that it will be
compatible with the M2000 and vice versa. The M2000 requires the drive to meet a small
sub-set of the standards, so even drives that do not fully meet the standards are often
compatible.
The best method to check if a drive is compatible with the M2000 is to insert it into the
front panel USB drive port. The USB Drive Info area on any main screen of the M2000 shows
the connection status. The indications are as follows (assuming no data logging is active):
NO USB DEVICE ATTACHED

The M2000 has not detected that any device is attached,
typically the unit will detect an attached device within
about 1 second. If the drive is attached but the unit remains
showing this for an extended period of time, the drive is not
compatible with USB2.0 full-speed operation and should be
removed.

USB DEVICE ATTACHING

This indicates that the M2000 has detected the device as
being attached and is performing the initial USB
enumeration of the device. This typically takes about 1
second, but on some drives may take a little longer.

USB DEVICE FAULT

This indicates that the M2000 has detected the device as
being attached but the device failed to enumerate properly.
This may indicate that the device draws more than 500mA
of power or that the drive is not compatible with the
USB2.0 specification. The drive should be removed and after

waiting a few seconds reinserted. If the message returns,
the drive is not compatible with the unit. This can also
sometimes be caused by a partial or intermittent insertion
of the drive into the unit. It is recommended to check if the
connections are clean.
USB DEVICE INCOMPATIBLE

This indicates that the drive has enumerated correctly, but
that the drive is either not detected as a Mass Storage Class
device or has multiple drives, and thus is not compatible
with the unit.

USB DRIVE MOUNTING

This indicates that the M2000 has detected the drive and is
attempting to mount the drive. For some drives this can
take several seconds, portable hard drives can take even
longer as the drive must achieve the correct rotation speed
before it will mount.

USB DRIVE INCOMPATIBLE

This indicates that the drive has been correctly detected
and has been correctly mounted, but inspection of the drive
has not found a valid FAT32 partition for the M2000 to use.
The drive may need to be formatted. Not all drives are
formatted with FAT32 when purchased – although most are
- so may require formatting on a computer before they can
be used with a M2000.

USB DRIVE READY

This indicates that the drive has been successfully
enumerated and mounted and is compatible with the
M2000. There is a very small possibility that the drive may
fail compatibility at some later point in time, such as when
reading or writing files, but this is very unlikely.

Note: While data is transferring between the drive and the M2000, the background of the
USB Drive Info area flashes a dark maroon color. Do not remove a drive while this is
colored. Many drives have an LED (or similar), on many drives this indicates activity
but on some drives this indicates connection state. Do not rely on a LED mounted on
the drive for deciding whether a drive can be safely removed.
If using a computer running Windows to format a drive:
 Depending on the size of the drive, the default for Windows may not be the
FAT32 format. In those cases you should ensure that the FAT32 format is
selected before starting to format the drive.
 For best performance, the Allocation Unit Size (or cluster size) should be set
to a setting of 8kbytes or higher (for most drives 16k is optimal for speed).
 For reasons unknown, some drives cannot be formatted by Windows to the
FAT32 format. In those cases, you may need to obtain a third party drive
format application to format the drive. There are several that are free of
charge available on the internet.

Files & File Names

The M2000 only operates on files in the root directory of the drive and only uses the 8.3
DOS style filename format. The M2000 does not include the ability to format a drive nor for
file management. These actions should be performed using a computer as needed.
Notes: By definition, 8.3 filenames are not case sensitive so the use of all UPPERCASE
letters is recommended in filenames to avoid confusion.
The following file names may not be used except for specific file types –

 M2000.S19
 M2000.HEX
 WELCOME.IMG
 VHLIMIT.CSV
 AHLIMIT.CSV

Checking the Drive File Structure

If a drive is accidently removed or the M2000 has its power removed while activity is in
progress, it is possible that the file structure of the drive has been damaged. It is
recommended to use a utility program on a computer to check for and repair any file
structure damage, which may have occurred if this is suspected.

Exporting Files to a Drive

Files can be exported to a USB drive by pressing the USB Drive Info area while a drive is

Binary .CFG Extension Files

These types of exported files have a proprietary binary format and are intended to be
imported into a M2000 at a later time.
You can have as many of these types of files on the drive as you wish, so you can have many
different configurations, custom screens or sets of harmonics limits etc. available in this
manner. You can also share these between different users of M2000’s, or use them to
maintain a record of a configuration used.
These files contain the following sections:
Configuration File
 All screen configurations.
 The custom screen definition.
 All measurement configurations.
 Any voltage and current harmonics limits defined.
 The measurement preference settings.

The file does not contain the power preference setting, the interface configuration or the
time and date format configuration settings.
These files are approximately 17K bytes in length.
Custom Data Screen Configuration File
These files are approximately 12K bytes in length.
Harmonic Limits File
This file contains both voltage and current harmonic limits.
These files are approximately 5K bytes in length.
9.6.3

Comma Separated Value .CSV Files

These types of exported files are in the CSV ASCII format and have the .CSV extension in the
filename. These are tabulated files of data suitable for directly importing into many
spreadsheet (e.g. Excel™) programs or text editors.
Each file is formatted as records (or rows or lines) of columns of data.
Each file has headings as the first record describing each column of data.
Recommendation: It is not recommended to rely on specific data being in a specific
location in the file. Future updates may add measurement results from
time to time, and measurement result availability may depend on
configuration, channel content, and options installed. This may mean
that a specific result is not always in exactly the same position in the
file. The file contains column headings (and row headings for some
formats) It is recommended to use these headings to determine the
meaning of results in specific locations of the file.
Notes: Some data may be blank. This indicates that the measurement is not available.
Unless otherwise shown, all data is in scientific numeric format using the natural
units for the measurement.
9.6.4

Measurements File

The file contains every measurement, including harmonics, in all VPAs and all channels.
These files are variable in length and can be up to 350K bytes long.
The first column of every record contains the description of that measurement, following
that are the results for that measurement for each channel or each VPA as appropriate in
each column.
There are separate sections of the file for channel based and VPA based data and the first
record of each section are headers describing each column.
The first section is the data for each VPA, below is an example of the first few records of the
VPA data section (only VPA1 has measurements available in this example).

Historical Measurements File

The contents of this file are configured by the trace selections on the HISTORY screen. The
file covers the period of time in 8192 equally spaced time increments between when the
history log was started up to either when the file is generated or when it was previously
stopped.
This contains the maximum, average and minimum measured data during each preceding
time increment. Unlike data logging, this is guaranteed to include all data measured during
that time increment so it actually has better event capture capability and extent recording
capability than a data log file and is considerably smaller and easier to generate, particularly
if measurement extents or trend analysis is the intention.
These files are variable in length, can be up to 1.3M bytes long and always contains 8193
records.
Note: If further traces covering the same period of time are to be exported in another file,
then stop the historical record first. Then repeatedly configure the desired traces
and export the file for those traces until all required traces have been exported.
Below is an example of the first few lines of this file. The time column is the time in seconds
units. This file can contain invalid data points at certain times because data at that specific
time was not captured, you should interpolate between the surrounding valid points as
needed.

SECTION 10: REMOTE CONTROL

The file must be named VHLIMIT.CSV to define the voltage harmonics limits, or AHLIMIT.CSV
to define the current harmonics limits. If present, these files are listed along with any binary
harmonics files present on the drive when the HARMONIC LIMITS file type is selected in the
IMPORT area of the screen.
Each line of the file must contain the following fields in the order shown with the comma
character separating each field –
1. The letter H.
2. A number of characters forming an integer between 1 and 500 inclusive which sets
the harmonic for which a limit is being set by this line.
a. The fundamental is harmonic 1.
b. If more than one line sets the limit for a harmonic, the last one is used.
c. The file does not need to define every harmonic; harmonics not included in
the file are not checked against a limit.
3. Either the character 1 if the limit is to be the highest of the percentage and level
limits, or 2 if the limit is to be the addition of the percentage and level limits.
4. Either the character 0 if the percentage limit is to be the percentage of the
fundamental amplitude or 1 if it is to be the percentage of the total signal.
5. A number of characters forming a floating number which is the percentage limit (in
percent).
6. A number of characters forming a floating number which is the level limit (in Volts
or Amps).
The file may contain blank lines if desired.
A simple example of the contents of such a file isH,2,1,0,0.1,1
H,3,2,1,0.2,2

This sets limits as follows:
 1st line: For harmonic 2, the higher of 0.1% of fundamental or 1V or A
 2nd line: For harmonic 3, the addition of 0.2% of signal and 2V or A
9.7.3

Creating and Importing ASCII Custom Screen Definition Files

You can create an ASCII format custom screen definition on a computer using a plain text
editor such as Windows Notepad. The file must be named CUSTOM.CSV. If present, this file
is listed along with any binary custom screen definition files present on the drive when the
CUSTOM SCREEN file type is selected in the IMPORT area of the screen.
A custom screen is like a spreadsheet composed of 57 cells arranged in 15 rows with row 0
(the topmost row) only having a single column (column 0) and rows 1 through 14 having 4
columns (the leftmost column is 0, the rightmost is 3).
For cells other than the row 0 cell, for text sizes other than 12pix or 16pix the target cell is
expanded to include surrounding cells as follows:
 22pix text size: includes the cell to the right of the target cell.

Updating Firmware

Firmware update files must have a specific filename. There are several types of update files;
most of these are associated with updating the firmware or the FPGA to a newly released
update. Follow the instructions provided with the firmware or FPGA release to import and
use these files.

9.8

Data Logging to a USB Drive

The M2000 has the capability of data logging up to 16 user defined measurements (or sets
of harmonics measurements) at a user defined interval. This can be performed to one of the
following:
1. To an external USB Drive, using an internal 32Mbyte buffer to reduce the impact
that drive speed has on the achievable data logging rate. The maximum rate of data
logging will be limited by the drive speed (see section 23.7.8).
2. To the internal 32Mbyte buffer. This will be automatically transferred to the
configured file on an external USB drive when one is subsequently connected. This
internal buffer is volatile, the contents will be lost if power is removed from the
M2000 or the M2000 is turned off. There is no restriction on the maximum data
logging rate (other than the length of the buffer).
3. To an internal memory in the M2000. This memory varies in size between individual
M2000 instruments, but is at least 2GBytes in length. This is non-volatile, that is the
contents will not be lost if power is removed from the unit or the unit is turned off.
The maximum rate of data logging will be slightly limited by the memory speed.
The following conditions apply to data logging:
Data which has been logged to internal memory can be exported to an external USB drive at
any future time by returning to this screen and pressing the EXPORT button next to the
information regarding the contents of the internal memory. The exported file can be in
either ASCII (.CSV) or binary (.BIN) formats. Once data has been logged to internal memory it
cannot be erased, it can only be overwritten by a further data logging operation to internal
memory.
Data logging can create very large files. You should ensure that the drive has sufficient room
available prior to starting data logging. If the maximum file size for FAT32 (4Gbytes) is
reached or the drive becomes full prior to you stopping data logging then data logging is
automatically stopped by the unit and a data logging error status is set.
Data logging to other than the internal memory allows you to insert the drive before, during
or after performing the data logging. An internal 32Mbyte internal FIFO buffer is used to
reduce the possibility of record loss caused by the absence of or a slow write speed of the
USB Drive. For shorter data logging (<8M data) you can use this internal buffer for data
logging and then save it to a drive later.
Data logging is not synchronous to any measurement period, but logs the latest
measurements at each respective time interval.

M2000 SERIES OPERATION MANUAL
SECTION 10: REMOTE CONTROL

In this manual, each set of data recorded at each data log interval is called a data log record,
and each data within each record is called a data. When logging to internal memory, internal
buffer, or an external binary file each data takes 4bytes. When logging to an external ASCII
file each data has a variable length, but is typically 12bytes.
Prior to performing data logging you must configure the file details, data logging timing, and
the file data contents. Initiating the screen that allows you to do this is achieved by pressing
the USB Drive Info area. If data logging is not in progress and a drive is presently inserted,
this will start the file import/export screen. In this case, press the DATALOG button on that
screen to access the data logging screen.
This screen can also be used to view the status of data logging while data is being captured.
You can either stay on this screen or return to it later to view the status. You do not have to
remain on this screen during data logging.

There are four areas on this screen, the lower area (shown in this example) showing the
status is only shown if either a data logging activity is presently taking place or a previously
run data log has been completed and a drive has not been both removed and inserted since
then.
9.8.1

Configuring the Data Log

This is performed by using the buttons in the FILE Area.
The FORMAT button allows you to select if the file is to be written to an external drive with
ASCII or BINARY data formats or is to be saved to INTERNAL memory.
If data is selected to be written to INTERNAL memory then there are no other buttons
shown in the FILE area.

M2000 SERIES OPERATION MANUAL
SECTION 10: REMOTE CONTROL

The internal memory in the power analyzer is typically over ten times faster than
external USB drives, allowing a faster data logging rate and/or more data to be
logged.
After capturing a data log to internal memory, you can export this at a later time or
date to an external drive in either ASCII or BINARY formats. You should note that the
amount of time taken to export this may be considerable as external memory is
considerably slower than the internal memory. You should also note that exporting
this into an external drive using the ASCII format results in a file which is typically
three times larger than the internal memory data, which may exceed the maximum
file size or the external drive size, in those cases you will need to export it in BINARY
format and convert that file on a computer to the ASCII format.
If data is selected to be written in ASCII format then it is written as one record per line,
with each data within the record being comma separated.
This is often called the CSV format and files generated in this format can usually be
opened with commercially available spreadsheet programs (such as Excel) and with
many data base programs.
You should first confirm that the application is able to open the size of file likely to
be generated while data logging, for example some versions of Excel can only open
a file with less than 65536 records.
If data is selected to be written in BINARY format, it can only be read using an
application provided with the power analyzer, which converts the file to ASCII format.
A binary file is nominally 3x smaller than the equivalent ASCII file so more data can
be written into the maximum allowed data log file size of 4Gbytes.
A binary file typically has a 3:1 faster writing speed than the equivalent ASCII file,
allowing shorter intervals to be used when logging to a slower drive.
Although the binary file is limited to 4Gbytes in length, the resulting ASCII file may
not be limited to this if it is saved in the supplied application to a drive which does
not use the FAT32 format (most computer hard drives use NTFS or later formats
which do not have this 4Gbyte limitation).
The FILENAME button allows you to set the name of the file which will be written.
Only filenames using the 8.3 form are allowed.
The extension is automatically provided (either .CSV or .BIN depending on the FORMAT
setting).
The following file names may not be used:
VHLIMIT.CSV
AHLIMIT.CSV
CUSTOM.CSV
The HEADER button allows you to select if the file will start with a header record or not (this
is only available for the ASCII FORMAT setting).

If a header is set to be included, then the first file record will contain a textual
description of each column of data.
Recommendation: It is recommended to always include a header. In this manner if the
file is inspected at a later date, it is not necessary to remember
what each data column corresponds to.
The APPEND FILE button allows you to select what will happen if the specified file already
exists on the drive when data logging is started (or the drive is subsequently inserted after
starting it).
Recommendation: APPEND should only be selected when it is known that the existing
data has the same format. If set to append to an existing file then
the existing contents of the file may not be of the correct format to
allow the file to be opened on a computer after completing the data
log.
9.8.2

Configuring Timing for Data Logging

This is performed by using the buttons in the TIMING Area.
The START DELAY button allows you to select if actual data logging is to start after a delay
has expired following pressing the START button.
In the data entry screens for START DELAY there are four entries, one for each unit of
days, hours, minutes and seconds.
The screen always starts with the days data selected; you can jump to any of the four
entries directly by pressing the respective entry area.
You can enter a numeric between 0 and 99 into any of the four entries. The actual time
used is the total time created by combining all four entries with their respective units.
When the ENT button is pressed the selected entry area automatically changes to next
entry to the right, unless the seconds entry is selected when the action is same as
pressing the overall RETURN button.
Pressing the RETURN button returns to the Data Logging Configure Screen and saves the
configured time, whereas pressing the CANCEL button returns to the Data Logging
Configure Screen without saving any changed data.
The RUN TIME button allows you to select if data logging is to run until manually stopped
(MANUAL) or to run for a specific period of time. If set to run for a specific time then the
entry of that time follows the same procedure as setting the START DELAY (above).
The INTERVAL button allows you to set the data logging interval. The entry of the interval
follows the same procedure as that for the START DELAY and the RUN TIME (above), but
uses a different set of four entries (hours, minutes, seconds, and 1/100th seconds). If an
interval time of 0 is entered then 0.002 seconds is used.

9.8.3

Configuring Data Logging Record Contents

This is performed by using the buttons in the DATA area.
The TIMESTAMP button allows you to select if each record is to contain the time of day and
date information, or not.
The first data of every record is always the record number which continuously
increments.
If enabled, the time of day is the second data of every record and in ASCII format it is
formatted as the prevalent time format setting for the unit (i.e. 12 or 24 hour format).
If enabled, the date is the third data of every record and in ASCII format it is formatted
as the prevalent date format setting for the unit (i.e. DD:MM:YYYY or MM:DD:YYYY).
Recommendation: It is recommended to always select that a timestamp will be
included, otherwise you will have no record of when a data log file
was actually generated.
The SELECT DATA button allows you to select each of the 16 data selections that will be
logged. The lower half of the button shows how many data in total (including the record
number and any timestamp information) will be generated by the present selections for the
SELECT DATA and TIMESTAMP settings. For the ASCII format, each data is typically 12 bytes
of storage, otherwise each data is exactly 4 bytes of storage.
Pressing the SELECT DATA button starts a screen which allows you to enable or disable each
of the 16 data selections and, if enabled, to select what data to log for each data selection.
The screen shown below is an example of this screen.

Only measurements which are presently configured to be measured can be selected while in
this screen.

SECTION 10: REMOTE CONTROL

Each ENABLE button is highlighted (green) if the data is enabled, otherwise the ENABLE
button is not highlighted and is colored grey.
If the SOURCE is selected to be from a VPA, there is a second SOURCE button which selects
whether the total for the VPA or that from a specific phase of the VPA is to be used.
If a harmonic list is selected as the MEASUREMENT, you must also enter the number of
harmonics to be listed. The listing always includes the fundamental up to and including this
entered harmonic. If a harmonic is not being measured at the data log time then the
respective data recorded is zero.
Typically each enabled entry is one field in the data log; however if a harmonic listing is
selected the entry will create the same number of fields as the number of harmonics set to
be listed.
You do not need to enable consecutive entries; the file will only contain fields for enabled
entries in the order defined and skip over entries that are not enabled. If an entry is not
enabled, any prior selection of the source and measurement data is still saved. This way, you
may have several different data logging data sets and change between them by changing
which entries are enabled.
Pressing the RETURN button returns to the Data Logging Configure Screen and saves the
configured data entries, whereas pressing the CANCEL button returns to the Data Logging
Configure Screen without saving any changes.
9.8.4

Starting and Stopping Data Logging

This is performed by using the START/STOP button on the right side of this screen.
Notes: If a data log has previously been performed but no drive was inserted to save that
data and then a further data log is started, the data captured by the prior data log
will be lost.
Stopping data logging only stops the collection of data, the data saved in the buffer
is still written out to the drive or to internal memory. You can also stop this by
pressing the ABORT button while not actively data logging but still writing the
internal buffer, but doing so may produce a partial final record in the resulting file.
9.8.5

Clearing Data from a Completed Unsaved Log

If a data log is performed to an external USB drive but is completed without a drive being
inserted to save that data then this prevents any other USB Drive activity (such as importing
or exporting a file) from being performed until this data is either saved to a drive or it is
cleared. The data may be cleared by pressing the CLEAR button on the right side of this
screen. The CLEAR button is only shown when a data log has been completed but no data
from it has been saved to a drive.

Viewing Data Logging Status

You can remain on this screen, or can return to this screen, to show the status of a
progressing data logging activity.
The status information shown in the lower area of this screen is:
 If logging to internal memory: The amount of that memory used and the total
available.
 If logging to an external drive (or to the internal buffer): The filename of the data log
file and the present size of it.
 A description of any errors that have occurred.
 A bar which shows the amount of the internal memory buffer which is presently
used (a green bar growing from the left as more buffer is used), and the maximum
amount used (a vertical line within the bar area). If this indicates that a significant
amount of the buffer has been used (>75%) then you should consider either using a
faster drive, logging less data, or using a longer data logging interval.
CAUTION: Removing a drive while data logging may damage the file system on the drive
and may render the drive and the data on it unusable. Once inserted and saving
data log data it must not be removed until the entire file has been written.
9.8.7

Exporting a Data Log from Internal Memory

If the internal memory contains data log records, these may be exported to an external
drive.
This is achieved by inserting the USB drive into the front panel port and pressing the
EXPORT button next to the INT MEMORY area on the data logging screen. After pressing this
you are prompted to enter the desired file format (ASCII or BINARY), followed by the desired
filename (the extension is automatically provided), followed by a request to overwrite the
file (only if it already exists on the USB drive). The file transfer is then initiated, and the
progress can be viewed in the status area on the lower part of this screen. The resultant file
always contains a header record.
Notes: Since a typical USB drive has a sustained write speed of 500Kbytes/sec (or possibly
less) and the internal memory can contain several Gbytes, this activity can take a
very long time (possibly several hours or more).
Once started you do not need to stay on this screen, you can continue to use the
power analyzer normally other than being unable to import or export files and not
being able to perform data logging.
If exporting to an ASCII format file then the resultant file will typically be 3x larger
than the amount of internal memory used. This might be more than the 4Gbyte file
size limit for FAT32. In this case, you should export the data in binary format and
externally convert it into ASCII using the supplied application.

SECTION 10: REMOTE CONTROL

9.8.8

Internal Buffer Usage

The M2000 has a large internal FIFO buffer (32Mbytes) which is used for data log data. This
buffer serves two purposes1. If you are data logging to a file on a drive then it reduces the impact on data logging
which inconsistencies in the write speed of the drive may have, or if it has an
insufficient sustained write speed.
2. It allows you to insert a drive to save the data log data at any time; before, during or
after performing the data log.
The progress bar shown in the lower portion of the Data Logging Configuration and Status
screen shows how much of this buffer is presently used and also the maximum amount
which has been used.
Notes: Data stored into this memory always has a binary format; the amount of this
memory used per data log record is given by (4 bytes x number of data shown in the
SELECT DATA button).
Data logging always saves the captured data into this internal buffer. At any time, if
data has been stored in this internal buffer and the drive is available and not busy,
then data is written from this buffer to the drive with the format configured.
This memory is volatile, so turning off the unit will lose any data stored in it.
If this buffer is overrun then data logging continues, but some records will be lost. It
will always be entire records which are lost if this occurs, not data within records, so
the integrity of the resulting file is unaffected.
Because writing data to the drive can lag behind the rate at which data is being
collected, data will continue to be saved to the drive after data logging has been
stopped manually or the configured run time has elapsed. Since the sustained write
speed of a USB Flash Drive may be <500Kbytes/sec and the buffer may contain up to
32Mbytes and the data written to the drive can be several times larger than the
data in the memory, this could continue for several minutes or more after stopping
data logging.
9.8.9

Optimizing and Testing File Write Speed

Generally the M2000 is not the limitation to the maximum achievable data logging rate to
an external USB drive. The drive average sustained write speed and the USB speed itself are
typically the main limitations.
If the total data log will be less than 8Mdata, speed is not of concern as the internal buffer is
large enough to accommodate this.
The internal memory in the M2000 has a much faster average sustained write speed than
external USB drives, but still needs to be considered when logging at very high rates and
with large data sets. The typical maximum sustained speed for the internal memory is over
5Mbytes/sec (1.25Mdata/sec), so if data logging at the maximum rate (0.002sec or 500/sec)

M2000 SERIES OPERATION MANUAL
SECTION 10: REMOTE CONTROL

the maximum amount of data per record which can be logged without record loss is 2500
data (higher at slower data logging rates).
Drives are not consistent in their timing; a typical drive will occasionally pause while writing
data which will cause the buffer usage bar to move in an inconsistent manner. It is
recommended to perform a test data log to a drive before attempting to create a
substantial data log file to ensure that the drive can support the required average data write
rate. This test run should be for at least a few minutes.
If the drive will not support the required mean sustained write speed required for the
desired data log interval and data then the internal buffer will fill up and records will be lost.
To achieve the fastest sustained average write speed with an external USB drive the
following recommendations are made:
 For most drives, a large allocation unit size (or cluster size) will achieve the fastest
sustained write speed. You may wish to reformat the drive to have a larger
allocation unit size than was present when purchased (16kbyte is recommended for
data logging). As an example the following results were obtained using a typical USB
Drive (4Gbyte size, writing a 70Mbyte file):
 4kbyte allocation unit (as purchased): 330kbytes/sec sustained speed
(82.5Kdata/sec in binary format)
 8kbyte allocation unit: 511kbytes/sec sustained speed (127.75Kdata/sec in
binary format)
 16kbyte allocation unit: 670kbytes/sec sustained speed (167.5Kdata/sec in
binary format)
 32kbyte allocation unit: 715kbytes/sec sustained speed (176.25Kdata/sec in
binary format)
 Note that these figures are far less than the published maximum write
speed for this device (3Mbytes/sec), but neither the bus speed nor the
M2000 were the limiting factors for the above tests.
 A typical drive is fastest if there are no other files on it; this ensures that the M2000
can write the file into consecutive areas of the drive.
 For best speeds, use a portable hard drive not a flash drive. Hard drives typically
have more consistent and faster write speeds.

M2000 SERIES OPERATION MANUAL
SECTION 10: REMOTE CONTROL

10 Remote Control Programming
There are a great many software languages, compilers and development platforms. It is
beyond the scope of this manual to attempt to provide you with complete assistance
regarding writing software to control the M2000, so it is described in general form.
Examples provided use the Microsoft Visual Studio Express 2012 development platform and
the VB.NET language. The examples are only portions of code. In actuality, you may wish to
provide handlers for recovering from timeout errors.
The protocol used for communications is entirely ASCII based, using the commonly used
command and data fields approach although not SCPI. The same protocol is used for all
interfaces.
Note: Use of the M2000 via an interface is not dependent on the front panel being set to
any specific screen.

10.1 RS232 Serial Interface
Available settings for RS232 communication are:
 Baud Rate 9600, 19200, 57600 or 115200
 Handshake Bi-directional, hardware (RTS/CTS)
 Data Bits 8
 Parity None
 Start/Stop Bits 1
 Connector 9-pin Male Dsub
 Interface Pinout Type DTE (same as PC computer)
 Cable required 9-wire female-female null modem cable, fully wired
 Cable Length < 50 ft (per standard, in practice considerably longer cable lengths are
often used without problems)
10.1.1

Connecting to the RS232 Interface

The RS232 connector located on the rear panel of the M2000 must be connected to the
computer. For a standard PC type computer this requires a 9-pin female-female null modem
cable. The pinout on the M2000’s connector is identical to that on a standard PC, so the
data and handshake lines must cross-over in the cable. Suitable cables are available from
several vendors in a selection of lengths.
Note: This cable must accommodate not only the data signals and ground, but also the
RTS, CTS and DTR signals as a minimum.
10.1.2

Using a USB to RS232 Convertor

Many computers do not have a native RS232 interface available anymore. If so, you may
need to use a USB-to-RS232 convertor (aka ‘dongle’) to provide the RS232 interface. Many
such convertors are commercially available but many do not have adequate performance. If
possible, use the M2000 USB interface instead.

M2000 Series Power Analyzers Operation Manual

M2000 SERIES OPERATION MANUAL
SECTION 10: REMOTE CONTROL

Although the use of a convertor may not appear to require the alteration of software
written by you for a direct RS232 port, the majority of USB-to-RS232 convertors have severe
latency delay (typically 10ms or more) for each transmitted and received string of
characters. In high-speed applications, this may severely restrict the overall speed. Also,
many convertors have buffers for transmitted and received characters within the convertor
itself. Experience has shown that the state of the buffer for characters transmitted from the
computer to the power analyzer is not properly managed in some convertors and can result
in buffer overrun. This can cause character loss when performing high-speed transfers of
commands to the unit. If using such a convertor and the user is experiencing data loss
(usually seen as randomly occurring command errors) then the following is recommended:
 Try a different brand convertor.
 Ensure you are using the latest driver for the convertor in your computer. If
changing between convertors, it is recommended to uninstall all previous USB-toRS232 convertor drivers after removing the present USB-to-RS232 convertor and
then rebooting the computer prior to installing a different convertor. Many different
manufacturers of convertors use a similar chip set and are detected as compatible
devices and may erroneously re-use the existing driver.
 Limit all transmitted data to a maximum of 64 characters and rate limit each packet
transmitted by using pauses in your software. In extreme cases, this 64 character
limit may need to be lowered. Experience has shown that some convertors are only
reliable when single characters are transmitted. The rate limiting time delay
between packets should be greater than the USB frame rate of 1ms.
 Some convertors rely on the mechanical ground connection from the RS232 end to
the convertor. Although a convertor may appear to be operating correctly, if the
screws mounting a RS232 cable to the convertor are not installed, the convertor
becomes very sensitive to interference. This typically gives a similar issue to the
buffer management issue noted above, but most often yields character loss in both
transmitted and received data.
10.1.3

Use of RS232 Control Signals

This section uses the signals names as they are present at the computer end of the cable.
The DTR signal (output from the computer) is used by the M2000 to detect that a controller
is present on the RS232 port so must be asserted for any interface activity to be recognized.
The cable used, any cable convertor used, the computer, and the software must all support
the DTR signal. If not included in the cable a disconnected DTR signal is seen by the M2000
as the absence of a computer and any characters received will be taken as interference and
discarded. If the correct DTR signal cannot be provided then a special cable can be
constructed which ties the DSR and DTR signals together, in this manner the M2000 itself
provides the DTR signal.
The DSR signal (input to the computer) is asserted by the M2000 whenever the RS232 port

cause for concern.

SECTION 10: REMOTE CONTROL

The CTS signal (input to the computer) is used by the M2000 to handshake data transmitted
from the computer and must be supported by the cable used, any cable convertor used, the
computer, and the software. Improper support for this signal is generally seen as occasional
errors in commands to the M2000 caused by command transmission corruption.
The RTS signal (output from the computer) is used by the M2000 to handshake data
transmitted from the M2000. Generally, this signal is not used by the computer so is not
often a cause for concern but it must be included in the cable as a disconnected signal
disables all data transmitted from the M2000.
10.1.4

Writing RS232 Control Software

Before your software can communicate with the M2000 it generally must create an object
for the specific serial port and configure it.
As an example the following lines of code configure and open the port for communications
(SerialPort1 is defined as a System.IO.Ports.SerialPort object):
SerialPort1.BaudRate = 115200
SerialPort1.PortName = “COM1”
SerialPort1.Handshake = IO.Ports.Handshake.RequestToSend
SerialPort1.ReadTimeout = 100
SerialPort1.WriteTimeout = 100
SerialPort1.DtrEnable = True
SerialPort1.Open()

Since the M2000 communicates entirely using the standard ASCII character set, methods for
sending and receiving character strings must be used, remembering to always terminate
both transmitted and received strings with the <CR> and/or <LF> characters.
To transmit a command string (TransmitString) to the M2000 the following is an example:
SerialPort1.WriteLine(TransmitString)

To receive a response string (ReceiveString) from the M2000 the following is an example:
Dim ReceiveString as String = SerialPort1.ReadLine()

10.2 LAN (Ethernet) Interface
Available settings for LAN / Ethernet communication are:
 Speed 10baseT or 100baseTX, auto-selected
 Duplex Half or full-duplex, auto-selected
 MDI/MDIX Auto-selected
 Protocols ICMPv4, ARP, UDP/IPv4, TCP/IPv4, DHCPv4, mDNS, IGMPv3 (reducing to
v1 or v2 automatically as needed)
 TCP Port 10733
 Max. MTU 1500 (maximum Ethernet payload)
 Remote Connections Only one remote connection is allowed at any given time
 Connector RJ45
 Cable required CAT5 or CAT5e, UTP or STP
 Cable Length <100m (per standard)

SECTION 10: REMOTE CONTROL

10.2.1

LAN Connection

The LAN connector located on the rear panel of the M2000 must be connected to your
network or connected to a computer either directly or through a switch (a hub is not
recommended). Standard CAT5e UTP cable is sufficient for the majority of applications and
the M2000 has auto MDI/MDIX so the use of a crossover cable is not necessary.
10.2.2

IP Addressing

Since the LAN interface of the M2000 uses IP communications, an IP address must be
assigned in some manner to the power analyzer. There are three methods of doing this as
described in section 12.3.2.31. Using a manually entered IP address, gateway and subnet mask.
2. Using an IP address, gateway and subnet mask obtained from a DHCP server (all
three must be provided by the server).
3. Using an IP address obtained by the Auto-IP method (RFC3927). The IP address will
be in the range from 169.254.1.0 to 169.254.254.255.
Whichever method is used, you should note the IP address of the M2000 and use that
address to communicate with the M2000 via the LAN interface. If you use a fixed manually
entered IP, this will not change unless the manual configuration of the M2000 is changed.
However, using DHCP it may occasionally change (depending on the specific DHCP server, it
may issue the same IP address each time or it may not) and using Auto-IP it will never be the
same IP address each time that the M2000 is linked. The actual IP address of the M2000 can
be viewed by pressing the Interface Info area available on most screens and if colored
orange, it should not be used as it has not been validated. Typically, it will change to white
text within a few seconds after which it may be used.
Notes: If using Auto-IP then the traffic to and from the M2000 should not be able to pass
through a router, so the M2000 must be local to the computer.
If using DHCP or Auto-IP then it may take some time to obtain a valid IP address
after attachment to the network. This typically takes a few seconds, but can
occasionally take considerably longer.
The M2000 does not support generating VLAN traffic, and although it can receive
VLAN formatted traffic it ignores the VLAN information. If used on a network which
uses VLAN then it should be located on a portion of that network which does not
have the VLAN content. Check with your IT department regarding this if necessary.
10.2.3

LAN Security Concerns

You may be concerned with the security of your network when connecting a M2000 to it.
Such a concern is generally unwarranted as the M2000 is not capable of any transfers that
can detrimentally affect other equipment or computers on the network.
Additionally, the M2000 can be configured for Auto-IP (RFC3927) IP addressing. In that case,
no traffic to or from the M2000 should be able to pass through a router, so the M2000 can
be made local to a portion of a network.

M2000 SERIES OPERATION MANUAL
SECTION 10: REMOTE CONTROL

Note: The M2000 generally has a benign presence on the LAN and does not broadcast any
traffic related to its presence on the LAN (other than DHCP traffic if enabled and
ARP traffic as needed).
The M2000 only supports:
 The DHCP Protocol (only if configured to use DHCP).
 The ARP protocol (only to ensure the uniqueness of its own IP address, and as
necessary to confirm the presence of the computer which has a TCP/IP socket
established to the M2000. The M2000 does not arbitrarily generate ARP requests).
 The ICMP reception of a ‘ping’ and the transmission of its response (it cannot
generate a ‘ping’).
 If the M2000 is configured to have an IDENTITY name, then this is verified as being
unique using mDNS when the M2000 is turned on, or just connected to the LAN, or
the identity name is changed. The identity capability may be disabled to remove the
capability of generating mDNS traffic.
 Transfer of ASCII data from the M2000 to a computer using streaming TCP/IP
protocol to which it has a TCP/IP socket established only when and as directed by
that computer (only a single socket is allowed by the M2000). Data transmitted
from the M2000 can only be measurement results and measurement status
information. These are all non-broadcast datagrams, so in a well-designed network
these datagrams will not be transmitted beyond the connection between the
computer and the M2000.
All LAN packets received that are not supported are silently discarded and ignored.
The M2000 does not support:
 Communications with a computer with which it does not have a TCP/IP socket
established (which can only be established by the computer, not by the M2000).
 Reception of any broadcast requests other than DHCP (only if enabled) and ARP (all
other received broadcasts are silently ignored).
 Transmission of any broadcast packets other than DHCP (only if enabled) and ARP
(only as required to ensure the uniqueness of its own IP address).
 Transporting any binary data.
 Any network management protocols such as SNMP, SSDP, LLDP, SDP, CDP etc., or
routing protocols such as RIP etc.
 Any ‘file system’, NETBIOS or similar protocols.
 Any HTTP, FTP, etc. which might enable a ‘program’ to be transferred to or from the
M2000 via the LAN.
 Any POP, SMTP, IMAP, NetBIOS, NetBT, IPX or similar protocols that can establish a
connection to another computer.
10.2.4

Writing LAN Control Software

All communication with the M2000 uses TCP/IP port 10733 on the M2000. The M2000 only
allows one active socket at any given time, so you should close the TCP/IP socket when
finished using it. To avoid unnecessary lockouts, the M2000 will allow a replacement socket
if the previously active socket is still open but has not been active for >1 minute. In this case,

M2000 SERIES OPERATION MANUAL
SECTION 10: REMOTE CONTROL

it will close the expired socket (this only occurs if a new socket is attempted, otherwise the
M2000 will keep a socket open even if it is not active).
TCP/IP has CRC error checking, packet loss detection, and automatic retransmission of lost
or corrupted data. This means that the user need not perform error checking using
commands such as *ERR? when using the LAN interface except for testing your software, as
each command is guaranteed to reach the M2000 without error.
Before your software can communicate with the M2000 it generally must create an object
for the socket and then configure and open it.
Dim enet_socket As System.Net.Sockets.TcpClient
enet_socket.Connect(System.Net.IPAddress.Parse(EnetIPAddrBox.Text),
10733) enet_socket.ReceiveTimeout = 1000

To close the socket the following is an example.
enet_socket.Close()

The example above shows using the IP address of a M2000 to open a connection to it.
Alternatively the identity name of the M2000 can used, but with ‘.local’ appended to the
end of it, as an example if the M2000 identity is M2000-123456 then a socket with it can be
opened using:
enet_socket.Connect(“M2000-123456.local”, 10733)

Opening a socket using the identity name has the advantage that you do not need to know
the IP address of the M2000, only its’ identity name, so your software does not need to be
modified to accommodate changes to the network configuration.
Since the M2000 communicates entirely using the standard ASCII character set, methods for
sending and receiving character strings must be used, remembering to always terminate
both transmitted and received strings with the <CR> and/or <LF> characters.
To transmit a command string (TransmitString) to the M2000 the following is an example:
Dim send_data As Byte() = System.Text.Encoding.ASCII.GetBytes
( TransmitString + Chr(10))
Dim send_len As Integer = cmd_string.Length
enet_socket.GetStream.Write(send_data, 0, send_len + 1)

To receive a response string (ReceiveString) from the M2000 the following is an example:
Dim sr As New System.IO.StreamReader(enet_socket.GetStream())
Dim ReceiveString as String = sr.ReadLine()

10.3 USB Interface
Available settings for USB communication are:
 Connector USB B connector
 Cable required USB 2.0 A-B Cable
 Compatibility Compatible with Windows XP and later operating systems
 USB Speed Full-speed
 USB Device Enumerates as a Human Interface Device (HID) of the Vendor-specific

SECTION 10: REMOTE CONTROL


10.3.1

Driver None required
USB Connection

The USB connector located on the rear panel of the M2000 must be connected to the
computer or a hub using a standard USB AB type cable. The use of a quality cable is
particularly recommended if interference is likely, as lower quality cables have poor
shielding (if any) and have a high RF impedance in the ground connection.
The M2000 does not require a vendor supplied driver, so no installation is required. When
the M2000 is first connected to a computer (sometimes to each specific USB port of a
computer), the operating system of the computer must load its native HID device driver.
This may take a short while. During that time, the M2000 cannot be communicated with via
the USB. The M2000 appears as a standard HID Input Device with Vendor-specific
properties. It is shown in the Windows Device Manager as a Human Interface Device -> USB
Input Device.
10.3.2

Writing USB Control Software

Since the M2000 appears as a standard HID Device with Vendor-specific properties, you
must communicate through the standard Windows® interface for such devices. This can be a
difficult task, so a pair of DLL files to ease this communication (SLABHIDtoUART.dll and
SLABHIDDevice.dll are provided. Both of these must be accessible to your program).
All attempts to open the port, transmit strings through the port, receive strings through the
port and close the port should be directly made through simple calls to these DLL files.
Header files defining these calls for VB.NET, for C# and for C/C++ are also provided
(SLABCP2110.vb, SLABCP2110.cs and SLABCP2110.h respectively).
When compiling applications using the Visual Studio development platform you should
compile for x86 processors otherwise there may be conflicts with the supplied DLL files.
Note that most communications require knowledge of the USB VID (Vendor ID) and PID
(Product ID) numbers used by the M2000. These are 4292 and 34869 respectively for all
M2000 units.
Before your software can communicate with the M2000 it generally must create an object
for the socket and then configure and open it.
Dim num_devices As Integer
Dim usbdevice As System.IntPtr
HidUart_GetNumDevices(num_devices, 4292, 34869)
If (num_devices > 0 And HidUart_Open(usbdevice, 0, 4292, 34869) =
HID_UART_SUCCESS) Then HidUart_SetUartConfig(usbdevice, 115200,
HID_UART_EIGHT_DATA_BITS, HID_UART_NO_PARITY, /
ID_UART_SHORT_STOP_BIT, HID_UART_RTS_CTS_FLOW_CONTROL)
HidUart_SetTimeouts(usbdevice, 0, 1000)
End If

To close the connection the following is an example.
HidUart_Close(usbdevice)

SECTION 10: REMOTE CONTROL

Since the M2000 communicates entirely using the standard ASCII character set, methods for
sending and receiving character strings must be used, remembering to always terminate
both transmitted and received strings with the <CR> and/or <LF> characters.
Although not shown here, you should check if the device handle is active by using the
HidUart_IsOpened function call prior making calls for transmitting or receiving data. If this
call indicates an invalid handle then you should repeat the process of opening a socket and
obtaining a new device handle. This is only needed when significant interference is present
and is necessary because some operating systems (e.g. Windows) disconnect a USB device
which has interference.
To transmit a command string (TransmitString) to the M2000 the following is an example:
Dim send_data As Byte() = System.Text.Encoding.ASCII.GetBytes
(cmd_string + Chr(10))
Dim send_len As Integer = cmd_string.Length
Dim written As Integer
HidUart_Write(usbdevice, send_data, send_len + 1, written)

To receive a response string (ReceiveString) from the M2000 the following is an example
' The USB only operates with byte arrays - so must handle each byte
' and detect the LF terminator
' Although usually all characters in a response are received in a
' single array, this cannot be ' relied upon
' Uses a 2 second timeout to receive a complete line (far longer than
' needed)
Dim Timer As Stopwatch = Stopwatch.StartNew()
Dim rx_lf As Boolean = False
ReceiveString = “”
While (Not (rx_lf))
Dim rx_data(1024) As Byte
Dim rx_index As Integer = 0
Dim bytes As Integer = 0
HidUart_Read(usbdevice, rx_data, 1024, bytes)
' Because we configured a 0 read timeout this will return
immediately if there’s no
' characters
While (bytes)
If (rx_data(rx_index) = 10)
Then rx_lf = True
Exit While
End If
rx_index += 1
bytes -= 1
End While
ReceiveString += System.Text.Encoding.ASCII.GetString(rx_data,
0, rx_index)
If (Timer.ElapsedMilliseconds > 2000) Then
' Timeout occurred – need to take some action here
Timer.Stop()
Exit Function
End If
End While

10.4 Command Syntax
All commands to the M2000 use the standard 7-bit ASCII character set using 8-bit encoding
(the 8th bit is zero), independent of the actual interface being used. A command is a stream
of characters.The M2000 stores received characters until a command terminator character
is received and only then is action taken on the commands. Further characters may be
received while the M2000 is taking the actions needed complete a preceding command but
no action will be taken on them until all pending command decode activity is completed.
Each command is a KEYWORD field defining the command, possibly followed by further
fields that refine the action of the command. The available command keywords and the
fields required for each are described in tables later in this section.
More than one command can be present in a single command set. In that case, each
command must be separated from the previous by a command separator character. If an
error is found in any command within a command set, that command and any remaining
commands which follow it in the command set will not be executed.
Since the interface is based on streaming ASCII characters, the use of separator and
terminator characters is required to ensure that the extents of each field can be established.
To improve the readability of commands you may also wish to employ whitespace
characters to spread apart fields.
10.4.1

Special Characters

Certain ASCII characters serve a special purpose as described below.
COMMAND TERMINATOR CHARACTERS
The end of a command set is determined by the presence of a command terminator
which may be the line-feed, carriage return, form feed or NULL (0 value) ASCII
characters.
Everything between successive command terminators is a command set. A command
set is limited to a maximum of 4095 characters in total. There is no action taken or error

generated if a command terminator is immediately followed by another command
terminator.
COMMAND SEPARATOR CHARACTER
If more than one command is in a command set then each successive command is
separated from the previous by a command separator, which is the semi-colon ASCII
character (;).
Everything between successive command separators or command terminators is a
command. There is no action taken or error generated if a command separator is
immediately followed by another command separator or a command terminator.
FIELD SEPARATOR CHARACTER
Most commands require command fields which refine the action of the command; each
field is separated from the previous by a field separator which is the comma ASCII
character (,).
Everything between successive field separators, command separators or command
terminators is a field.
SUB-FIELD SEPARATOR CHARACTER
In some cases a single command field is made up of several sub-fields; each sub-field is
separated from a previous sub-field by a sub-field separator, which is the colon ASCII
character (:).
Everything between successive sub-field separators, field separators, command
separators or command terminators is a sub-field.
WHITESPACE CHARACTERS
Most fields and sub-fields can have one or more whitespace characters at the beginning
and/or end. The space, tab and underscore ASCII characters are considered as
whitespace characters.
10.4.2

Command Fields

Command fields are one of the types described below. In certain cases, a single field may be
formed by multiple sub-fields, in which case each successive sub-field (each having one of
the field types described below) is separated from the previous by a preceding sub-field
separator character.
KEYWORD COMMAND FIELD SYNTAX
A KEYWORD field is a combination of printable ASCII characters which match the
corresponding allowable keywords as described later. A KEYWORD field is not casesensitive (e.g. the letters V and v are equivalent) and may be preceded and/or followed
by one or more whitespace characters but may not contain any whitespace characters
within it.
Examples of valid KEYWORD fields are:

A STRING field is any combination of any printable ASCII characters in the range ‘space’
through ‘z’. A STRING field is literal, containing the exact definition of the required
string. However, certain characters have special meaning:
! The Ω character
\ The ø character
$ The μ character
^ The Σ character
[ The up arrow character
` The down arrow character
] The ° character
‘ The center dot character
Note: STRING fields are only terminated by a command terminator or separator
character and may contain what would normally be any other separator
character (if printable).
Examples of valid STRING fields are:
This is a string field
Volts:
NR1 COMMAND FIELD SYNTAX
A NR1 field is any combination of ASCII numeric (0 through 9) characters which form an
integer value. A NR1 command field must not include a polarity character. A NR1 field
may be preceded and/or followed by one or more whitespace characters but may not
contain any whitespace characters within it.
All NR1 fields must be in the range 0 to 4294967295 and will cause a syntax error if
outside of this range and in most commands this range is further limited and will cause a
data range error if that range is exceeded.
Examples of valid NR1 fields are:
10
153465782
NR3 COMMAND FIELD SYNTAX
A NR3 field is any combination of ASCII characters which form a floating point value. A
NR3 field may be preceded and/or followed by one or more whitespace characters but
may not contain any whitespace characters within it.
All NR3 fields are decoded and used within the M2000 with approximately 1 in 107
resolution and may be in the range -10+99 to 10+99 and may contain a number of
characters which is only limited by the maximum length of a command set.

10.4.3

Command Responses

Some commands cause the M2000 to respond with a requested data response or set of data
responses. The response is formed by a set of fields, similar to those for commands
described above.
Note: All command keywords which end with the ? character cause a response. All
command keywords which do not end with the ? character do not cause a response.
All responses from the M2000 use the standard 7-bit ASCII character set using 8-bit
encoding (the 8th bit is zero) independent of the actual interface being used.
You may request more than one response in a set of commands. In this case, each response
(or set of responses) is separated from the previous by a comma separator and the
responses are included in the same order as they were requested. A complete response is
always terminated by a carriage return followed by a line feed ASCII character and may
contain up to 65535 characters in total.
It is expected that after a command is given to the unit to produce a response, the
originator will not issue further commands requesting a response until that prior response
has been fully received. If the unit receives a command which requests a response but the
prior response has not been fully transmitted, it this raises a Tx Overrun error.
As defined for each such command a response is one or more fields, each of which is of the
following types:
STRING RESPONSE FIELD SYNTAX
A STRING response is a set of ASCII characters forming the response. Only printable
ASCII characters are used and the length of a STRING response is variable, the
terminating comma (if more response fields follow it) or the terminating carriage return
and line feed characters should be used to determine the end of a STRING field.
NR1 RESPONSE FIELD SYNTAX
A NR1 response is a set of ASCII numeric characters defining an integer value. The length
of a NR1 response is variable, the terminating comma (if more response fields follow it)
or the terminating carriage return and line feed characters should be used to determine
the end of a NR1 field. A NR1 response never includes a polarity symbol, as all such
responses are positive.
NR3 RESPONSE FIELD SYNTAX
A NR3 response is a set of ASCII characters defining a floating-point numeric value. The
length of a NR3 response is fixed at 11 characters however it is recommended that the
terminating comma (if more response fields follow it) or the terminating carriage return
and line feed characters be used to determine the end of a NR3 field.
A NR3 response always has the following parts in the order shown:


A polarity character, defining the polarity of the numeric 6 digit characters with
an embedded decimal point character, defining the mantissa portion of the
numeric

SECTION 10: REMOTE CONTROL





The letter E character (upper case)
A polarity character, defining the polarity of the exponent
A single digit character defining the exponent (which is always a multiple of 3)

Note: There is a special case of a NR3 response used to indicate that the data is not
available. Normally a zero value uses a +0.00000E-9 response; a response of
+0.00000E+0 indicates that the value is unavailable.

10.5 Command Keywords and Fields
In the tables below, the specified command KEYWORD should be followed by each field (if
any) in the order described in the table with each field separated from the previous by a
field separator character. E.g. VSCALE,1,0 – turns off voltage scaling for channel 1.
Notes: For clarity, each command within each section is listed in alphabetical order and all
tables listing those commands have the same column usage.
Where the FIELD(s) column indicates a dash (-) then that command requires no
fields.
Where the FIELD(s) column indicates that fields are required, then those fields must
be included with the command in the order shown in the table.
10.5.1

Interface Clear Commands

Both of these commands perform the same function. The use of either of these commands

Local / Remote State Control Commands

The M2000 automatically enters the REMOTE state when any command is received via an
interface. While in the REMOTE state a front panel user cannot change the measurement or
interface configuration without first selecting to return to the LOCAL state. Interface
commands are always actioned independent of the LOCAL/REMOTE state. These commands
are invalid commands if received via the GPIB interface.

Error Register Query Commands

Each register accumulates interface command errors and is cleared when read. The use of
the ERR register is recommended, the OPC and ESR registers are included for legacy
purposes.
It is not recommended to include an error register query command with any other
commands in a set of commands; any syntax error in those other commands may cause the
error register query command to not be actioned.
These commands should be used following commands during testing of your software; they
may be removed later if desired. For the LAN interface it is highly unlikely that a command
will be corrupted, so the regular use of this type of error checking is not necessary; however
for the USB and RS232 interfaces it is possible for commands to become corrupted during
transmission to the M2000 so the use of the *ERR? command is recommended in high
interference environments.
The ERR register is automatically cleared when an interface is disconnected or when a LAN
interface socket is closed.
Non-zero contents of the ERR register cause the screen of the M2000 to indicate an error
message in the Error Info Area. This message remains until the ERR register is cleared.

Configuration Store and Recall Commands

The M2000 contains 10 internal configuration storage areas into which you may save all
configuration settings other than the power preference setting, the interface configuration
and the time and date format configuration settings.
There is also a FACTORY configuration storage allowing you to set the configuration settings
to the factory defaults (this storage cannot be overwritten).

Measurement Configuration Edit Commands

The Measurement Configuration Edit commands shown below have been split into separate
sections for clarity. All of the commands described in these sections are controlled by the
EDITCONFIG and SAVECONFIG commands.
While performing an internal DC zero you should not send any of these commands to the
M2000.
These commands are checked only for syntax and compatibility with the installed hardware
(if applicable) when each command is received and are not executed and the consistency of
setting combinations are not checked until the SAVECONFIG command is used. In this
manner you may configure measurements using these commands in any order without the
need to consider intermediate potentially incompatible setting combinations. For this
reason, the CH1 to CH4 variants of the VDEF field format are not allowed for these
commands.
If you are unsure if there are any pending commands from these sections (e.g. from a prior
session where the SAVECONFIG command was not used) then you may use the EDITCONFIG
command to ensure that there are none (the *RST or *CLS command also accomplish this
and are the recommended method but also perform other functions).
A typical command flow is:
1. Send the EDITCONFIG command (only to ensure there are no previously unsaved
measurement configuration changes)
2. Send the required measurement configuration commands (in any order)

Removes all voltage (i=V) or current (i=A) harmonic limits
Sets voltage (i=V) or current (i=A) limit for harmonic h according
to the remaining fields as follows:
t sets the type of limit (if any) to apply:
t=0: no limit applied (further fields are optional and are ignored
if present)
t=1: the limit is the highest of the percentage and level limits
t=2: the limit is the addition of the percentage and level limits
p sets whether the percentage limit is a percentage of the
fundamental (p=0) or of the total signal (p=1)
plimit and llimit are the percentage and level limits respectively
Note : setting a limit with both plimit and llimit =0.0 will never
pass
Responds with the HLIMIT command STRING needed to
reproduce the voltage (i=V) or current (i=A) limit for harmonic h
Saves all voltage (i=V) or current (i=A) harmonic limits

DESCRIPTION
Initiates an INT DC ZERO activity on all configured channels
(same as the SYS CONFIG -> INT DC ZERO button)
Sets DCZ register as needed and clears DCZERR register
Suspends normal measurement actions of the M2000 until
ENDDCZERO is received
Responds with the NR1 DCZ register:
b0 through 3: set if CH 1 through 4 resp. are performing an INT
DC Zero activity
Each bit clears when the activity is successfully completed or
ENDDCZERO commanded
Responds with the NR1 DCZERR register:
b0 through 3: set if CH 1 through 4 resp. have found an error
during an INT DC Zero activity
Terminates an INT DC ZERO activity on all channels (aborts if still
in progress)
Clears DCZ and DCZERR registers
Returns to normal measurement actions.
Performs an external DC Zero. If o is 0 then all channels have
their DC zeroes adjusted to the present DC measurements,
otherwise if o is 1 then only those channels which are scaled
have their DC zeroes adjusted to the present DC measurements.

Custom Screen Configuration and Query Commands
The actual custom screen is not updated with the results of any changes until the
SAVECUSTOM command is actioned. The use of the CLRCUSTOM command is recommended
prior to starting to generate a custom screen via the interface to ensure that no existing
contents of a custom screen are included in a newly generated screen. Following a
SAVECUSTOM command no further custom screen commands can be executed for up to
300ms and attempting to do so raises an error.
Note that the CUSTOM command must either be the only command or the last command in
a set of commands (i.e. it must be terminated by a command terminator character).
A custom screen is composed of 57 cells arranged in 15 rows with row 0 (the topmost row)
only having a single column and rows 1 through 14 having 4 columns (the leftmost column is
0). For cells other than the row 0 cell, for text sizes other than 12pix or 16pix then the target
cell is expanded to include surrounding cells as follows:



22pix text size: includes the cell to the right of the target cell.
28pix and 36pix text sizes: includes the cell to the right of the target cell and also the
cells immediately below both the target cell and that to the right of it.

DESCRIPTION
Responds with the 512 data points of cycle view data for
channel c voltage (s=V), current (s=A) or power (s=W)
waveforms
The data points correspond to phases of the fundamental
starting at 0° and then at successive (360/512)° increments.
Each data point contains two fields as follows –
1st field : NR1 indicating if this data point has a valid data (1) or
not (0)
2nd field : NR3 indicating the level at this data point
Note – the response is a large number of characters
(approximately 7K) and is a total of 1024 fields. Not all data
points may be valid, interpolate between valid data points as
appropriate.
Responds with one NR3 harmonic amplitude for the voltage
input (i=V) or current input (i=A) or power (i=W) of channel c for
each harmonic starting with the start harmonic up to and
including the end harmonic (the fundamental is harmonic 1).
Responds with n data points of historical data defined by def,
starting at historical data collection time start and ending at end
(both in seconds relative to the time at which historical data
collection was last started)
Each data point is four fields as follows –
1st field: NR1 indicating if this data point contains data (1) or
not (0)
2nd field: NR3 indicating the maximum data recorded
3rd field: NR3 indicating the average data recorded
4th field: NR3 indicating the minimum data recorded
Note – the response can be a very large number of characters
(up to 38.9K) and fields (up to 4096).
Responds with an NR3 indicating the length of time covered by
the present historical data (in seconds)
Responds with a NR1 indicating if harmonic h (h>0) or all
harmonics (h=0) for the voltage (i=V) or current (i=A) of channel
c is passing (responds with 0) or failing (responds with 1)

DESCRIPTION
Note: A harmonic which has no limit or is not being measured is
considered as passing
Responds with a NR1 indicating if the selected data source (srce)
has a leading PF (responds with 1) or lagging PF (responds with
0)
srce is either:
A1 to A3: selects VPA1 to 3 as the data source
VPA1 to VPA3: selects VPA1 to 3 as the data source
CH1 to CH4: selects channel 1 to channel 4 as the data source
Responds with a NR1 indicating the number of harmonics being
measured in VPA v
Responds with the requested measurement result(s). You may
specify any number of results to be obtained in a single READ?
Command, as long as the command is within the allowable
maximum number of characters in a command set and the
response generated is less than the maximum number of
characters in a response.
Responds with the measurement results defined by the last
received READ? command.
Note: This is typically used when a large number of results are
to be repeatedly requested and a slow interface (e.g. USB or
RS232) is being used. Sending the READ? command once and
then repeating by using the REREAD? command achieves higher
throughput because of the reduction in characters required.
When using the LAN interface, there is typically very little
difference if the REREAD? command is used vs using the READ?
Command.
Responds with n data points of scope view data defined by c
and s, starting at time start and ending at end (both in seconds
relative to the trigger detection time)
Each data point is three fields as follows –
1st field: NR1 indicating if this data point contains data (1) or
not (0)
2nd field: NR3 indicating the minimum level at this data point
3rd field: NR3 indicating the maximum level at this data point
Note: The response can be a very large number of characters
(up to 55.3K) and fields (up to 6144).
Note: If the requested timespan is a small fraction of the
captured timespan then not all response data may have valid
data.
Responds with a NR1 indicating if the M2000 measurement
error was outside of the requirements of EN50564 at any time
during the measurement (responds with 1) or not (responds
with 0)
Responds with n data points of standby historical data defined
by def, ending at relative time end (in seconds relative to the
time at which the standby measurement was started)

Responds with a NR1 indicating if the voltage crest factor was
outside of the requirements of EN50564 at any time during the
measurement (responds with 1) or not (responds with 0)
Responds with a NR1 indicating if the voltage distortion was
outside of the requirements of EN50564 at any time during the
measurement (responds with 1) or not (responds with 0)

M2000 SERIES OPERATION MANUAL
SECTION 11: CALIBRATION

11 Calibration
11.1 Overview
Calibration adjustment should be rarely needed; however you may wish to perform it at periodic
intervals to ensure optimal performance.









The M2000 employs internal software calibration adjustments, there are no physical
adjustments required. These adjustments are needed to correct for manufacturing
tolerances in the components used in the M2000.
It is important to note that there is no calibration of electro-mechanical performance
(e.g. high frequency response) or design defects, giving you a high degree of certainty
that the M2000 maintains its’ specifications.
Calibration adjustment can only be performed via an interface using a Windows
application program provided by the manufacturer. This application does not control
the source of the voltage or current being used for adjustment, it only controls the
M2000. You should ensure:
• The computer used has a suitable interface installed.
• The computer used has the supplied M2000 calibration adjustment application
installed.
• The M2000 has been properly configured for the interface chosen.
Calibration adjustment should only be performed after the M2000 has been
continuously powered in a stable environment for at least 1 hour. If the M2000 has
been moved between differing environments, then at least 3 hours should be allowed.
In the procedure below, each installed channel is calibrated separately and the
procedure varies automatically depending on the channel type (the 1st letter of the
channel code) and the channel current option (the 2nd letter of the channel code).
The supplied application automatically saves the measurement configuration of the
M2000 prior to reconfiguring it for calibration adjustments and restores the saved
configuration after calibration adjustment has been completed.
The M2000 may be adjusted at any frequency between 45 and 450Hz. It normally
produces the optimum results to calibrate the M2000 at 50, 55 or 60Hz. At these
frequencies the specifications of the source are typically the most accurate. When
calibrating at very low signal levels you may experience interference from the local
mains supply, in these cases it is recommended to adjust the M2000 at a frequency of
other than the local mains supply. The accuracy difference in the M2000 between 50, 55
or 60Hz is extremely small and may be ignored, and the difference between performing
the adjustments at near mains frequency vs. 400Hz for aerospace applications may also
be disregarded as the difference in the M2000 accuracy is negligible at the adjustment
levels.

SECTION 11: CALIBRATION

11.2 Calibration Equipment Required
The following equipment will be required during calibration adjustment1. A short circuit capable of being attached between the V or A terminals of the M2000
channels (standard 4mm banana terminals using ¾ inch spacing) and a method of
grounding the short circuit. This short circuit should be constructed to minimize
thermally induced EMFs.
2. A source of AC voltages into a 1.2Mohm load (S or A channel types) or 400Kohm load (W
channel types) of 10V, 20V, and 200Vrms at a frequency of between 45 and 450Hz (the
use of 50Hz or 60Hz is recommended) with sufficient amplitude accuracy to ensure the
desired ratio between the specified M2000 accuracy and that of the applied voltage. For
a 4:1 TUR (typically used) the voltage source should have an accuracy of
<0.025%+0.75mV (S or W channel types) or < 0.0075% + 0.5mV (A channel types) at
these levels.
3. (Only required for channels having the AD current option) A source of AC current into a
0.02ohm load (plus the impedance of the wiring between the M2000 and the source) at
1A, 2A and 10Arms at a frequency of between 45 and 450Hz (the use of 50Hz or 60Hz is
recommended) with sufficient amplitude accuracy to ensure the desired ratio between
the specified M2000 accuracy and that of the applied current. For a 4:1 TUR (typically
used) the current source should have an accuracy of <0.0075% + 75uA at these levels.
4. (Only required for channels having the AD current option) A source of AC current into a
0.57ohm load (plus the impedance of the wiring between the M2000 and the source) at
100mArms at a frequency of between 45 and 450Hz (the use of 50Hz or 60Hz is
recommended) with sufficient amplitude accuracy to ensure the desired ratio between
the specified M2000 accuracy and that of the applied current. For a 4:1 TUR (typically
used) the current source should have an accuracy of < 0.007875% at these levels.
5. (Only required for channels having the AX current option) A source of AC voltage into a
20.5Kohm load at 0.1V, 0.5V, 2V and 10Vrms at a frequency of between 45 and 450Hz
(the use of 50Hz or 60Hz is recommended) with sufficient amplitude accuracy to ensure
the desired ratio between the specified M2000 accuracy and that of the applied voltage.
For a 4:1 TUR (typically used) the voltage source should have an accuracy of < 0.0075% +
7.5uV (A channel types) at these levels. Note that some sources may require that you
adjust the voltage setting to achieve the correct voltage into a 20.5Kohm load for option
AX or a 205Kohm load for option V.
6. (Only required for channels having the AX current option) A source of AC voltage into a
10.25Kohm load at 200mVrms at a frequency of between 45 and 450Hz (the use of 50Hz
or 60Hz is recommended) with sufficient amplitude accuracy to ensure the desired ratio
between the specified M2000 accuracy and that of the applied voltage. For a 4:1 TUR
(typically used) the voltage source should have an accuracy of < 0.007815% at these
levels. Note that some sources may require that you adjust the voltage setting to
achieve the correct voltage into a 10.25Kohm load for option X or a 102.5Kohm load for
option V.

11.3 Adjustment Procedure
After first running the software application provided and connecting the chosen interface
between the computer and the M2000, you should perform the actions of each of the following
sections.
11.3.1

Calibration Program Interface Connection

In the INTERFACE TO UNIT TO BE ADJUSTED area of the application:
1. Using the radio buttons, select the chosen interface to the M2000.
2. If using the RS232 interface select the baud rate for the RS232 interface.
3. If using the LAN interface type in the IP address of the M2000. This can be seen by
pressing the LAN info area on the M2000screen.
4. Press the CONNECT button, this will then be relabeled DISCONNECT and the
identification of the M2000will be shown underneath the button after the application
has correctly established communications with the M2000. This shows the model
number, any installed option contents, the serial number and the main firmware
version. The installed channels, along with their type and option and serial numbers will
be listed with radio buttons in the ADJUSTMENT CHANNEL SELECTION area of the
application.
5. Check that you have connected to the correct M2000and that it has expected serial
number and channel content.
6. (If required) Press the SET DATE and TIME button. This will set the date and time of the
M2000to that of the computer.

Adjust Each Channel

Each channel is adjusted separately, so the procedure below should be performed for each
channel installed in the unit. After a channel has been adjusted “- ADJUSTED” is shown following
its serial number in the ADJUSTMENT CHANNEL SELECTION area of the application.
1. Using the radio buttons in the ADJUSTMENT CHANNEL SELECTION area, select the
channel to be adjusted.
2. Ensure that there are no connections to any channel terminals of the M2000.
3. Press the START ADJUSTMENTS OF SELECTED CHANNEL button.

a) During each step in the adjustment procedure the same actions are needed (not all
steps may be present and the source required in each step varies depending on the
channel type and option being adjusted)a) Note the expected input to the terminals as noted in the SOURCE LEVEL and
CONNECTIONS window and apply the source as requested. Ensure that only the
expected connections are made to the M2000, there should be no other
connections during any step in the procedure.
b) When the requested input has been provided, press the START ADJUSTMENT STEP
button.

c) For the zero adjustment steps (steps 1, 2 and 3): the ADJUSTMENT area shows the
target level (always zero), the actual M2000 reading, and the applied adjustment. These
are each in volts or amps units depending on the zero being adjusted. Adjustment is
automatic for these steps, so you should just press the FINISH ADJUSTMENT STEP
button for each when you are satisfied that the zero has been fully adjusted.
i.
Where a short circuit is requested to be applied, you should also ground the
short circuit.
ii.
Where an open circuit is requested to be applied, all terminals should have no
connections.
iii.
Particularly for the LO range X or V option DC zero adjustment (step 3 for the
X or V option) there may be thermally induced voltages on the short circuit
being used. For step 3 of the X or V current option adjustment it is
recommended to wait at least 1 minute for any thermals to have dissipated
before pressing the FINISH ADJUSTMENT STEP button.
iv.
You should be aware of the M2000 specifications for the channel and step
being adjusted. Using this will assist you in determining if you are satisfied
with the adjustment or not. In some steps the last digit is not trimmed to be
exactly correct.
d) For the scaling adjustment steps (steps 4 onwards): the ADJUSTMENT area shows the
target level (which may be overwritten if desired), the actual M2000 reading (both in
Volts or Amps as applicable), the applied adjustment (in percent) and allows you to
either adjust the M2000 manually or automatically. If applying the adjustment manually
then you can change the size of each step with the COARSE, MEDIUM and FINE radio
buttons and the target value is not used. If applying the adjustment automatically then
the user must ensure that the correct target value is entered and the source is fully
settled before checking the AUTO ADJUST checkbox. When you are satisfied with the
adjustment press the FINISH ADJUSTMENT STEP button to proceed to the next step.
i. You should be aware of the M2000 specifications for the channel and step being
adjusted. Using this will assist you in determining if you are satisfied with the

adjustment or not. If you adjust the reading down to the last digit then in some
circumstances this will yield unnecessarily long adjustment times and in some
steps the last digit cannot be trimmed to be exactly correct.
e) After the last step has been completed for this channel (there are up to 12 steps for
each channel) press the SAVE ADJUSTMENTS button to save the adjustments to the
channel and return to selecting the next channel to adjust.
f)

11.3.3

NOTE: pressing the ABORT ADJUSTMENTS button at any time during the adjustment of a
channel will discard any adjustments made to that channel until the SAVE
ADJUSTMENTS button is pressed.
Finishing the Procedure

When all adjustments have been performed on all channels requiring adjustment, the user may
press the DISCONNECT button to disconnect the application from the M2000. The adjustments
were saved when each channel adjustment was completed.
WARNING: Do not remove power from the M2000 during or until at least 10 seconds after
completing adjustments.
